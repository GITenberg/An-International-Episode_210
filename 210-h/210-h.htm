    <h2>
      PART I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Four years ago&mdash;in 1874&mdash;two young Englishmen had occasion to go
      to the United States. They crossed the ocean at midsummer, and, arriving
      in New York on the first day of August, were much struck with the fervid
      temperature of that city. Disembarking upon the wharf, they climbed into
      one of those huge high-hung coaches which convey passengers to the hotels,
      and with a great deal of bouncing and bumping, took their course through
      Broadway. The midsummer aspect of New York is not, perhaps, the most
      favorable one; still, it is not without its picturesque and even brilliant
      side. Nothing could well resemble less a typical English street than the
      interminable avenue, rich in incongruities, through which our two
      travelers advanced&mdash;looking out on each side of them at the
      comfortable animation of the sidewalks, the high-colored, heterogeneous
      architecture, the huge white marble facades glittering in the strong,
      crude light, and bedizened with gilded lettering, the multifarious
      awnings, banners, and streamers, the extraordinary number of omnibuses,
      horsecars, and other democratic vehicles, the vendors of cooling fluids,
      the white trousers and big straw hats of the policemen, the tripping gait
      of the modish young persons on the pavement, the general brightness,
      newness, juvenility, both of people and things. The young men had
      exchanged few observations; but in crossing Union Square, in front of the
      monument to Washington&mdash;in the very shadow, indeed, projected by the
      image of the <i>pater patriae</i>&mdash;one of them remarked to the other,
      &ldquo;It seems a rum-looking place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, very odd, very odd,&rdquo; said the other, who was the clever man of the
      two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pity it&rsquo;s so beastly hot,&rdquo; resumed the first speaker after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know we are in a low latitude,&rdquo; said his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; remarked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said the second speaker presently, &ldquo;if they can give one a
      bath?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay not,&rdquo; rejoined the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; cried his comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      This animated discussion was checked by their arrival at the hotel, which
      had been recommended to them by an American gentleman whose acquaintance
      they made&mdash;with whom, indeed, they became very intimate&mdash;on the
      steamer, and who had proposed to accompany them to the inn and introduce
      them, in a friendly way, to the proprietor. This plan, however, had been
      defeated by their friend&rsquo;s finding that his &ldquo;partner&rdquo; was awaiting him on
      the wharf and that his commercial associate desired him instantly to come
      and give his attention to certain telegrams received from St. Louis. But
      the two Englishmen, with nothing but their national prestige and personal
      graces to recommend them, were very well received at the hotel, which had
      an air of capacious hospitality. They found that a bath was not
      unattainable, and were indeed struck with the facilities for prolonged and
      reiterated immersion with which their apartment was supplied. After
      bathing a good deal&mdash;more, indeed, than they had ever done before on
      a single occasion&mdash;they made their way into the dining room of the
      hotel, which was a spacious restaurant, with a fountain in the middle, a
      great many tall plants in ornamental tubs, and an array of French waiters.
      The first dinner on land, after a sea voyage, is, under any circumstances,
      a delightful occasion, and there was something particularly agreeable in
      the circumstances in which our young Englishmen found themselves. They
      were extremely good natured young men; they were more observant than they
      appeared; in a sort of inarticulate, accidentally dissimulative fashion,
      they were highly appreciative. This was, perhaps, especially the case with
      the elder, who was also, as I have said, the man of talent. They sat down
      at a little table, which was a very different affair from the great
      clattering seesaw in the saloon of the steamer. The wide doors and windows
      of the restaurant stood open, beneath large awnings, to a wide pavement,
      where there were other plants in tubs, and rows of spreading trees, and
      beyond which there was a large shady square, without any palings, and with
      marble-paved walks. And above the vivid verdure rose other facades of
      white marble and of pale chocolate-colored stone, squaring themselves
      against the deep blue sky. Here, outside, in the light and the shade and
      the heat, there was a great tinkling of the bells of innumerable
      streetcars, and a constant strolling and shuffling and rustling of many
      pedestrians, a large proportion of whom were young women in
      Pompadour-looking dresses. Within, the place was cool and vaguely lighted,
      with the plash of water, the odor of flowers, and the flitting of French
      waiters, as I have said, upon soundless carpets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather like Paris, you know,&rdquo; said the younger of our two travelers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like Paris&mdash;only more so,&rdquo; his companion rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s the French waiters,&rdquo; said the first speaker. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
      they have French waiters in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy a French waiter at a club,&rdquo; said his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Englishman started a little, as if he could not fancy it. &ldquo;In
      Paris I&rsquo;m very apt to dine at a place where there&rsquo;s an English waiter.
      Don&rsquo;t you know what&rsquo;s-his-name&rsquo;s, close to the thingumbob? They always set
      an English waiter at me. I suppose they think I can&rsquo;t speak French.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; And the elder of the young Englishmen unfolded his
      napkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion took no notice whatever of this declaration. &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he
      resumed in a moment, &ldquo;I suppose we must learn to speak American. I suppose
      we must take lessons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand them,&rdquo; said the clever man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce is HE saying?&rdquo; asked his comrade, appealing from the
      French waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is recommending some soft-shell crabs,&rdquo; said the clever man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, in desultory observation of the idiosyncrasies of the new society
      in which they found themselves, the young Englishmen proceeded to dine&mdash;going
      in largely, as the phrase is, for cooling draughts and dishes, of which
      their attendant offered them a very long list. After dinner they went out
      and slowly walked about the neighboring streets. The early dusk of waning
      summer was coming on, but the heat was still very great. The pavements
      were hot even to the stout boot soles of the British travelers, and the
      trees along the curbstone emitted strange exotic odors. The young men
      wandered through the adjoining square&mdash;that queer place without
      palings, and with marble walks arranged in black and white lozenges. There
      were a great many benches, crowded with shabby-looking people, and the
      travelers remarked, very justly, that it was not much like Belgrave
      Square. On one side was an enormous hotel, lifting up into the hot
      darkness an immense array of open, brightly lighted windows. At the base
      of this populous structure was an eternal jangle of horsecars, and all
      round it, in the upper dusk, was a sinister hum of mosquitoes. The ground
      floor of the hotel seemed to be a huge transparent cage, flinging a wide
      glare of gaslight into the street, of which it formed a sort of public
      adjunct, absorbing and emitting the passersby promiscuously. The young
      Englishmen went in with everyone else, from curiosity, and saw a couple of
      hundred men sitting on divans along a great marble-paved corridor, with
      their legs stretched out, together with several dozen more standing in a
      queue, as at the ticket office of a railway station, before a brilliantly
      illuminated counter of vast extent. These latter persons, who carried
      portmanteaus in their hands, had a dejected, exhausted look; their
      garments were not very fresh, and they seemed to be rendering some
      mysterious tribute to a magnificent young man with a waxed mustache, and a
      shirtfront adorned with diamond buttons, who every now and then dropped an
      absent glance over their multitudinous patience. They were American
      citizens doing homage to a hotel clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he didn&rsquo;t tell us to go there,&rdquo; said one of our Englishmen,
      alluding to their friend on the steamer, who had told them so many things.
      They walked up the Fifth Avenue, where, for instance, he had told them
      that all the first families lived. But the first families were out of
      town, and our young travelers had only the satisfaction of seeing some of
      the second&mdash;or perhaps even the third&mdash;taking the evening air
      upon balconies and high flights of doorsteps, in the streets which radiate
      from the more ornamental thoroughfare. They went a little way down one of
      these side streets, and they saw young ladies in white dresses&mdash;charming-looking
      persons&mdash;seated in graceful attitudes on the chocolate-colored steps.
      In one or two places these young ladies were conversing across the street
      with other young ladies seated in similar postures and costumes in front
      of the opposite houses, and in the warm night air their colloquial tones
      sounded strange in the ears of the young Englishmen. One of our friends,
      nevertheless&mdash;the younger one&mdash;intimated that he felt a
      disposition to interrupt a few of these soft familiarities; but his
      companion observed, pertinently enough, that he had better be careful. &ldquo;We
      must not begin with making mistakes,&rdquo; said his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he told us, you know&mdash;he told us,&rdquo; urged the young man, alluding
      again to the friend on the steamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind what he told us!&rdquo; answered his comrade, who, if he had greater
      talents, was also apparently more of a moralist.
    </p>
    <p>
      By bedtime&mdash;in their impatience to taste of a terrestrial couch again
      our seafarers went to bed early&mdash;it was still insufferably hot, and
      the buzz of the mosquitoes at the open windows might have passed for an
      audible crepitation of the temperature. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stand this, you know,&rdquo;
       the young Englishmen said to each other; and they tossed about all night
      more boisterously than they had tossed upon the Atlantic billows. On the
      morrow, their first thought was that they would re-embark that day for
      England; and then it occured to them that they might find an asylum nearer
      at hand. The cave of Aeolus became their ideal of comfort, and they
      wondered where the Americans went when they wished to cool off. They had
      not the least idea, and they determined to apply for information to Mr. J.
      L. Westgate. This was the name inscribed in a bold hand on the back of a
      letter carefully preserved in the pocketbook of our junior traveler.
      Beneath the address, in the left-hand corner of the envelope, were the
      words, &ldquo;Introducing Lord Lambeth and Percy Beaumont, Esq.&rdquo; The letter had
      been given to the two Englishmen by a good friend of theirs in London, who
      had been in America two years previously, and had singled out Mr. J. L.
      Westgate from the many friends he had left there as the consignee, as it
      were, of his compatriots. &ldquo;He is a capital fellow,&rdquo; the Englishman in
      London had said, &ldquo;and he has got an awfully pretty wife. He&rsquo;s tremendously
      hospitable&mdash;he will do everything in the world for you; and as he
      knows everyone over there, it is quite needless I should give you any
      other introduction. He will make you see everyone; trust to him for
      putting you into circulation. He has got a tremendously pretty wife.&rdquo; It
      was natural that in the hour of tribulation Lord Lambeth and Mr. Percy
      Beaumont should have bethought themselves of a gentleman whose attractions
      had been thus vividly depicted; all the more so that he lived in the Fifth
      Avenue, and that the Fifth Avenue, as they had ascertained the night
      before, was contiguous to their hotel. &ldquo;Ten to one he&rsquo;ll be out of town,&rdquo;
       said Percy Beaumont; &ldquo;but we can at least find out where he has gone, and
      we can immediately start in pursuit. He can&rsquo;t possibly have gone to a
      hotter place, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s only one hotter place,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth, &ldquo;and I hope he
      hasn&rsquo;t gone there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They strolled along the shady side of the street to the number indicated
      upon the precious letter. The house presented an imposing
      chocolate-colored expanse, relieved by facings and window cornices of
      florid sculpture, and by a couple of dusty rose trees which clambered over
      the balconies and the portico. This last-mentioned feature was approached
      by a monumental flight of steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather better than a London house,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth, looking down from
      this altitude, after they had rung the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends upon what London house you mean,&rdquo; replied his companion. &ldquo;You
      have a tremendous chance to get wet between the house door and your
      carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth, glancing at the burning heavens, &ldquo;I &lsquo;guess&rsquo; it
      doesn&rsquo;t rain so much here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened by a long Negro in a white jacket, who grinned
      familiarly when Lord Lambeth asked for Mr. Westgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t at home, sah; he&rsquo;s downtown at his o&rsquo;fice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, at his office?&rdquo; said the visitors. &ldquo;And when will he be at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sah, when he goes out dis way in de mo&rsquo;ning, he ain&rsquo;t liable to
      come home all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was discouraging; but the address of Mr. Westgate&rsquo;s office was freely
      imparted by the intelligent black and was taken down by Percy Beaumont in
      his pocketbook. The two gentlemen then returned, languidly, to their
      hotel, and sent for a hackney coach, and in this commodious vehicle they
      rolled comfortably downtown. They measured the whole length of Broadway
      again and found it a path of fire; and then, deflecting to the left, they
      were deposited by their conductor before a fresh, light, ornamental
      structure, ten stories high, in a street crowded with keen-faced,
      light-limbed young men, who were running about very quickly and stopping
      each other eagerly at corners and in doorways. Passing into this brilliant
      building, they were introduced by one of the keen-faced young men&mdash;he
      was a charming fellow, in wonderful cream-colored garments and a hat with
      a blue ribbon, who had evidently perceived them to be aliens and helpless&mdash;to
      a very snug hydraulic elevator, in which they took their place with many
      other persons, and which, shooting upward in its vertical socket,
      presently projected them into the seventh horizontal compartment of the
      edifice. Here, after brief delay, they found themselves face to face with
      the friend of their friend in London. His office was composed of several
      different rooms, and they waited very silently in one of them after they
      had sent in their letter and their cards. The letter was not one which it
      would take Mr. Westgate very long to read, but he came out to speak to
      them more instantly than they could have expected; he had evidently jumped
      up from his work. He was a tall, lean personage and was dressed all in
      fresh white linen; he had a thin, sharp, familiar face, with an expression
      that was at one and the same time sociable and businesslike, a quick,
      intelligent eye, and a large brown mustache, which concealed his mouth and
      made his chin, beneath it, look small. Lord Lambeth thought he looked
      tremendously clever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Lord Lambeth&mdash;how do you do, sir?&rdquo; he said, holding
      the open letter in his hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to see you; I hope you&rsquo;re very
      well. You had better come in here; I think it&rsquo;s cooler,&rdquo; and he led the
      way into another room, where there were law books and papers, and windows
      wide open beneath striped awning. Just opposite one of the windows, on a
      line with his eyes, Lord Lambeth observed the weathervane of a church
      steeple. The uproar of the street sounded infinitely far below, and Lord
      Lambeth felt very high in the air. &ldquo;I say it&rsquo;s cooler,&rdquo; pursued their
      host, &ldquo;but everything is relative. How do you stand the heat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say we like it,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth; &ldquo;but Beaumont likes it better
      than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it won&rsquo;t last,&rdquo; Mr. Westgate very cheerfully declared; &ldquo;nothing
      unpleasant lasts over here. It was very hot when Captain Littledale was
      here; he did nothing but drink sherry cobblers. He expressed some doubt in
      his letter whether I will remember him&mdash;as if I didn&rsquo;t remember
      making six sherry cobblers for him one day in about twenty minutes. I hope
      you left him well, two years having elapsed since then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, he&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am always very glad to see your countrymen,&rdquo; Mr. Westgate pursued. &ldquo;I
      thought it would be time some of you should be coming along. A friend of
      mine was saying to me only a day or two ago, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s time for the
      watermelons and the Englishmen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Englishmen and the watermelons just now are about the same thing,&rdquo;
       Percy Beaumont observed, wiping his dripping forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, we&rsquo;ll put you on ice, as we do the melons. You must go down to
      Newport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go anywhere,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you want to go to Newport; that&rsquo;s what you want to do,&rdquo; Mr. Westgate
      affirmed. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s see&mdash;when did you get here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only yesterday,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, by the Russia. Where are you staying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Hanover, I think they call it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty comfortable?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Westgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems a capital place, but I can&rsquo;t say we like the gnats,&rdquo; said Lord
      Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Westgate stared and laughed. &ldquo;Oh, no, of course you don&rsquo;t like the
      gnats. We shall expect you to like a good many things over here, but we
      shan&rsquo;t insist upon your liking the gnats; though certainly you&rsquo;ll admit
      that, as gnats, they are fine, eh? But you oughtn&rsquo;t to remain in the
      city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we think,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth. &ldquo;If you would kindly suggest something&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suggest something, my dear sir?&rdquo; and Mr. Westgate looked at him,
      narrowing his eyelids. &ldquo;Open your mouth and shut your eyes! Leave it to
      me, and I&rsquo;ll put you through. It&rsquo;s a matter of national pride with me that
      all Englishmen should have a good time; and as I have had considerable
      practice, I have learned to minister to their wants. I find they generally
      want the right thing. So just please to consider yourselves my property;
      and if anyone should try to appropriate you, please to say, &lsquo;Hands off;
      too late for the market.&rsquo; But let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; continued the American, in his
      slow, humorous voice, with a distinctness of utterance which appeared to
      his visitors to be part of a humorous intention&mdash;a strangely
      leisurely, speculative voice for a man evidently so busy and, as they
      felt, so professional&mdash;&ldquo;let&rsquo;s see; are you going to make something of
      a stay, Lord Lambeth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no,&rdquo; said the young Englishman; &ldquo;my cousin was coming over on
      some business, so I just came across, at an hour&rsquo;s notice, for the lark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it your first visit to the United States?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was obliged to come on some business,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont, &ldquo;and I
      brought Lambeth along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And <i>you</i> have been here before, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never&mdash;never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought, from your referring to business&mdash;&rdquo; said Mr. Westgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you see I&rsquo;m by way of being a barrister,&rdquo; Percy Beaumont answered. &ldquo;I
      know some people that think of bringing a suit against one of your
      railways, and they asked me to come over and take measures accordingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your railroad?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Tennessee Central.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The American tilted back his chair a little and poised it an instant.
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry you want to attack one of our institutions,&rdquo; he said,
      smiling. &ldquo;But I guess you had better enjoy yourself <i>first</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m certainly rather afraid I can&rsquo;t work in this weather,&rdquo; the young
      barrister confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave that to the natives,&rdquo; said Mr. Westgate. &ldquo;Leave the Tennessee
      Central to me, Mr. Beaumont. Some day we&rsquo;ll talk it over, and I guess I
      can make it square. But I didn&rsquo;t know you Englishmen ever did any work, in
      the upper classes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we do a lot of work; don&rsquo;t we, Lambeth?&rdquo; asked Percy Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must certainly be at home by the 19th of September,&rdquo; said the younger
      Englishman, irrelevantly but gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the shooting, eh? or is it the hunting, or the fishing?&rdquo; inquired his
      entertainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I must be in Scotland,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth, blushing a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Westgate, &ldquo;you had better amuse yourself first,
      also. You must go down and see Mrs. Westgate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should be so happy, if you would kindly tell us the train,&rdquo; said Percy
      Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a train&mdash;it&rsquo;s a boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see. And what is the name of&mdash;a&mdash;the&mdash;a&mdash;town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a town,&rdquo; said Mr. Westgate, laughing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a&mdash;well, what
      shall I call it? It&rsquo;s a watering place. In short, it&rsquo;s Newport. You&rsquo;ll see
      what it is. It&rsquo;s cool; that&rsquo;s the principal thing. You will greatly oblige
      me by going down there and putting yourself into the hands of Mrs.
      Westgate. It isn&rsquo;t perhaps for me to say it, but you couldn&rsquo;t be in better
      hands. Also in those of her sister, who is staying with her. She is very
      fond of Englishmen. She thinks there is nothing like them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Westgate or&mdash;a&mdash;her sister?&rdquo; asked Percy Beaumont
      modestly, yet in the tone of an inquiring traveler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I mean my wife,&rdquo; said Mr. Westgate. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose my sister-in-law
      knows much about them. She has always led a very quiet life; she has lived
      in Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Percy Beaumont listened with interest. &ldquo;That, I believe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the
      most&mdash;a&mdash;intellectual town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it is very intellectual. I don&rsquo;t go there much,&rdquo; responded his
      host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, we ought to go there,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord Lambeth, wait till the great heat is over,&rdquo; Mr. Westgate
      interposed. &ldquo;Boston in this weather would be very trying; it&rsquo;s not the
      temperature for intellectual exertion. At Boston, you know, you have to
      pass an examination at the city limits; and when you come away they give
      you a kind of degree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lambeth stared, blushing a little; and Percy Beaumont stared a little
      also&mdash;but only with his fine natural complexion&mdash;glancing aside
      after a moment to see that his companion was not looking too credulous,
      for he had heard a great deal of American humor. &ldquo;I daresay it is very
      jolly,&rdquo; said the younger gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay it is,&rdquo; said Mr. Westgate. &ldquo;Only I must impress upon you that
      at present&mdash;tomorrow morning, at an early hour&mdash;you will be
      expected at Newport. We have a house there; half the people in New York go
      there for the summer. I am not sure that at this very moment my wife can
      take you in; she has got a lot of people staying with her; I don&rsquo;t know
      who they all are; only she may have no room. But you can begin with the
      hotel, and meanwhile you can live at my house. In that way&mdash;simply
      sleeping at the hotel&mdash;you will find it tolerable. For the rest, you
      must make yourself at home at my place. You mustn&rsquo;t be shy, you know; if
      you are only here for a month that will be a great waste of time. Mrs.
      Westgate won&rsquo;t neglect you, and you had better not try to resist her. I
      know something about that. I expect you&rsquo;ll find some pretty girls on the
      premises. I shall write to my wife by this afternoon&rsquo;s mail, and tomorrow
      morning she and Miss Alden will look out for you. Just walk right in and
      make yourself comfortable. Your steamer leaves from this part of the city,
      and I will immediately send out and get you a cabin. Then, at half past
      four o&rsquo;clock, just call for me here, and I will go with you and put you on
      board. It&rsquo;s a big boat; you might get lost. A few days hence, at the end
      of the week, I will come down to Newport and see how you are getting on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two young Englishmen inaugurated the policy of not resisting Mrs.
      Westgate by submitting, with great docility and thankfulness, to her
      husband. He was evidently a very good fellow, and he made an impression
      upon his visitors; his hospitality seemed to recommend itself consciously&mdash;with
      a friendly wink, as it were&mdash;as if it hinted, judicially, that you
      could not possibly make a better bargain. Lord Lambeth and his cousin left
      their entertainer to his labors and returned to their hotel, where they
      spent three or four hours in their respective shower baths. Percy Beaumont
      had suggested that they ought to see something of the town; but &ldquo;Oh, damn
      the town!&rdquo; his noble kinsman had rejoined. They returned to Mr. Westgate&rsquo;s
      office in a carriage, with their luggage, very punctually; but it must be
      reluctantly recorded that, this time, he kept them waiting so long that
      they felt themselves missing the steamer, and were deterred only by an
      amiable modesty from dispensing with his attendance and starting on a
      hasty scramble to the wharf. But when at last he appeared, and the
      carriage plunged into the purlieus of Broadway, they jolted and jostled to
      such good purpose that they reached the huge white vessel while the bell
      for departure was still ringing and the absorption of passengers still
      active. It was indeed, as Mr. Westgate had said, a big boat, and his
      leadership in the innumerable and interminable corridors and cabins, with
      which he seemed perfectly acquainted, and of which anyone and everyone
      appeared to have the entree, was very grateful to the slightly bewildered
      voyagers. He showed them their stateroom&mdash;a spacious apartment,
      embellished with gas lamps, mirrors en pied, and sculptured furniture&mdash;and
      then, long after they had been intimately convinced that the steamer was
      in motion and launched upon the unknown stream that they were about to
      navigate, he bade them a sociable farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, goodbye, Lord Lambeth,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;goodbye, Mr. Percy Beaumont. I
      hope you&rsquo;ll have a good time. Just let them do what they want with you.
      I&rsquo;ll come down by-and-by and look after you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young Englishmen emerged from their cabin and amused themselves with
      wandering about the immense labyrinthine steamer, which struck them as an
      extraordinary mixture of a ship and a hotel. It was densely crowded with
      passengers, the larger number of whom appeared to be ladies and very young
      children; and in the big saloons, ornamented in white and gold, which
      followed each other in surprising succession, beneath the swinging
      gaslight, and among the small side passages where the Negro domestics of
      both sexes assembled with an air of philosophic leisure, everyone was
      moving to and fro and exchanging loud and familiar observations.
      Eventually, at the instance of a discriminating black, our young men went
      and had some &ldquo;supper&rdquo; in a wonderful place arranged like a theater, where,
      in a gilded gallery, upon which little boxes appeared to open, a large
      orchestra was playing operatic selections, and, below, people were handing
      about bills of fare, as if they had been programs. All this was
      sufficiently curious; but the agreeable thing, later, was to sit out on
      one of the great white decks of the steamer, in the warm breezy darkness,
      and, in the vague starlight, to make out the line of low, mysterious
      coast. The young Englishmen tried American cigars&mdash;those of Mr.
      Westgate&mdash;and talked together as they usually talked, with many odd
      silences, lapses of logic, and incongruities of transition; like people
      who have grown old together and learned to supply each other&rsquo;s missing
      phrases; or, more especially, like people thoroughly conscious of a common
      point of view, so that a style of conversation superficially lacking in
      finish might suffice for reference to a fund of associations in the light
      of which everything was all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We really seem to be going out to sea,&rdquo; Percy Beaumont observed. &ldquo;Upon my
      word, we are going back to England. He has shipped us off again. I call
      that &lsquo;real mean.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth. &ldquo;I want to see those pretty
      girls at Newport. You know, he told us the place was an island; and aren&rsquo;t
      all islands in the sea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed the elder traveler after a while, &ldquo;if his house is as good
      as his cigars, we shall do very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems a very good fellow,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth, as if this idea had just
      occurred to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, we had better remain at the inn,&rdquo; rejoined his companion
      presently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I like the way he spoke of his house. I don&rsquo;t
      like stopping in the house with such a tremendous lot of women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth. And then they smoked a while in
      silence. &ldquo;Fancy his thinking we do no work in England!&rdquo; the young man
      resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay he didn&rsquo;t really think so,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess they don&rsquo;t know much about England over here!&rdquo; declared
      Lord Lambeth humorously. And then there was another long pause. &ldquo;He was
      devilish civil,&rdquo; observed the young nobleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, certainly, could have been more civil,&rdquo; rejoined his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Littledale said his wife was great fun,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose wife&mdash;Littledale&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This American&rsquo;s&mdash;Mrs. Westgate. What&rsquo;s his name? J.L.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beaumont was silent a moment. &ldquo;What was fun to Littledale,&rdquo; he said at
      last, rather sententiously, &ldquo;may be death to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; asked his kinsman. &ldquo;I am as good a man as
      Littledale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy, I hope you won&rsquo;t begin to flirt,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. I daresay I shan&rsquo;t begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a married woman, if she&rsquo;s bent upon it, it&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo;
       Beaumont expounded. &ldquo;But our friend mentioned a young lady&mdash;a sister,
      a sister-in-law. For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t get entangled with her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean entangled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depend upon it she will try to hook you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bother!&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;American girls are very clever,&rdquo; urged his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; the young man declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy they are always up to some game of that sort,&rdquo; Beaumont
      continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t be worse than they are in England,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth
      judicially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but in England,&rdquo; replied Beaumont, &ldquo;you have got your natural
      protectors. You have got your mother and sisters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother and sisters&mdash;&rdquo; began the young nobleman with a certain
      energy. But he stopped in time, puffing at his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother spoke to me about it, with tears in her eyes,&rdquo; said Percy
      Beaumont. &ldquo;She said she felt very nervous. I promised to keep you out of
      mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better take care of yourself,&rdquo; said the object of maternal and
      ducal solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; rejoined the young barrister, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the expectation of a
      hundred thousand a year, not to mention other attractions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t cry out before you&rsquo;re hurt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was certainly very much cooler at Newport, where our travelers found
      themselves assigned to a couple of diminutive bedrooms in a faraway angle
      of an immense hotel. They had gone ashore in the early summer twilight and
      had very promptly put themselves to bed; thanks to which circumstance and
      to their having, during the previous hours, in their commodious cabin,
      slept the sleep of youth and health, they began to feel, toward eleven
      o&rsquo;clock, very alert and inquisitive. They looked out of their windows
      across a row of small green fields, bordered with low stone walls of rude
      construction, and saw a deep blue ocean lying beneath a deep blue sky, and
      flecked now and then with scintillating patches of foam. A strong, fresh
      breeze came in through the curtainless casements and prompted our young
      men to observe, generally, that it didn&rsquo;t seem half a bad climate. They
      made other observations after they had emerged from their rooms in pursuit
      of breakfast&mdash;a meal of which they partook in a huge bare hall, where
      a hundred Negroes, in white jackets, were shuffling about upon an
      uncarpeted floor; where the flies were superabundant, and the tables and
      dishes covered over with a strange, voluminous integument of coarse blue
      gauze; and where several little boys and girls, who had risen late, were
      seated in fastidious solitude at the morning repast. These young persons
      had not the morning paper before them, but they were engaged in languid
      perusal of the bill of fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      This latter document was a great puzzle to our friends, who, on reflecting
      that its bewildering categories had relation to breakfast alone, had an
      uneasy prevision of an encyclopedic dinner list. They found a great deal
      of entertainment at the hotel, an enormous wooden structure, for the
      erection of which it seemed to them that the virgin forests of the West
      must have been terribly deflowered. It was perforated from end to end with
      immense bare corridors, through which a strong draught was blowing&mdash;bearing
      along wonderful figures of ladies in white morning dresses and clouds of
      Valenciennes lace, who seemed to float down the long vistas with expanded
      furbelows, like angels spreading their wings. In front was a gigantic
      veranda, upon which an army might have encamped&mdash;a vast wooden
      terrace, with a roof as lofty as the nave of a cathedral. Here our young
      Englishmen enjoyed, as they supposed, a glimpse of American society, which
      was distributed over the measureless expanse in a variety of sedentary
      attitudes, and appeared to consist largely of pretty young girls, dressed
      as if for a fete champetre, swaying to and fro in rocking chairs, fanning
      themselves with large straw fans, and enjoying an enviable exemption from
      social cares. Lord Lambeth had a theory, which it might be interesting to
      trace to its origin, that it would be not only agreeable, but easily
      possible, to enter into relations with one of these young ladies; and his
      companion (as he had done a couple of days before) found occasion to check
      the young nobleman&rsquo;s colloquial impulses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better take care,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont, &ldquo;or you will have an
      offended father or brother pulling out a bowie knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you it is all right,&rdquo; Lord Lambeth replied. &ldquo;You know the
      Americans come to these big hotels to make acquaintances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about it, and neither do you,&rdquo; said his kinsman, who, like
      a clever man, had begun to perceive that the observation of American
      society demanded a readjustment of one&rsquo;s standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it, then let&rsquo;s find out!&rdquo; cried Lord Lambeth with some impatience.
      &ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t want to miss anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will find out,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont very reasonably. &ldquo;We will go and
      see Mrs. Westgate and make all proper inquiries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so the two inquiring Englishmen, who had this lady&rsquo;s address inscribed
      in her husband&rsquo;s hand upon a card, descended from the veranda of the big
      hotel and took their way, according to direction, along a large straight
      road, past a series of fresh-looking villas embosomed in shrubs and
      flowers and enclosed in an ingenious variety of wooden palings. The
      morning was brilliant and cool, the villas were smart and snug, and the
      walk of the young travelers was very entertaining. Everything looked as if
      it had received a coat of fresh paint the day before&mdash;the red roofs,
      the green shutters, the clean, bright browns and buffs of the housefronts.
      The flower beds on the little lawns seemed to sparkle in the radiant air,
      and the gravel in the short carriage sweeps to flash and twinkle. Along
      the road came a hundred little basket phaetons, in which, almost always, a
      couple of ladies were sitting&mdash;ladies in white dresses and long white
      gloves, holding the reins and looking at the two Englishmen, whose
      nationality was not elusive, through thick blue veils tied tightly about
      their faces as if to guard their complexions. At last the young men came
      within sight of the sea again, and then, having interrogated a gardener
      over the paling of a villa, they turned into an open gate. Here they found
      themselves face to face with the ocean and with a very picturesque
      structure, resembling a magnified chalet, which was perched upon a green
      embankment just above it. The house had a veranda of extraordinary width
      all around it and a great many doors and windows standing open to the
      veranda. These various apertures had, in common, such an accessible,
      hospitable air, such a breezy flutter within of light curtains, such
      expansive thresholds and reassuring interiors, that our friends hardly
      knew which was the regular entrance, and, after hesitating a moment,
      presented themselves at one of the windows. The room within was dark, but
      in a moment a graceful figure vaguely shaped itself in the rich-looking
      gloom, and a lady came to meet them. Then they saw that she had been
      seated at a table writing, and that she had heard them and had got up. She
      stepped out into the light; she wore a frank, charming smile, with which
      she held out her hand to Percy Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you must be Lord Lambeth and Mr. Beaumont,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have heard
      from my husband that you would come. I am extremely glad to see you.&rdquo; And
      she shook hands with each of her visitors. Her visitors were a little shy,
      but they had very good manners; they responded with smiles and
      exclamations, and they apologized for not knowing the front door. The lady
      rejoined, with vivacity, that when she wanted to see people very much she
      did not insist upon those distinctions, and that Mr. Westgate had written
      to her of his English friends in terms that made her really anxious. &ldquo;He
      said you were so terribly prostrated,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mean by the heat?&rdquo; replied Percy Beaumont. &ldquo;We were rather
      knocked up, but we feel wonderfully better. We had such a jolly&mdash;a&mdash;voyage
      down here. It&rsquo;s so very good of you to mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s so very kind of you,&rdquo; murmured Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westgate stood smiling; she was extremely pretty. &ldquo;Well, I did mind,&rdquo;
       she said; &ldquo;and I thought of sending for you this morning to the Ocean
      House. I am very glad you are better, and I am charmed you have arrived.
      You must come round to the other side of the piazza.&rdquo; And she led the way,
      with a light, smooth step, looking back at the young men and smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other side of the piazza was, as Lord Lambeth presently remarked, a
      very jolly place. It was of the most liberal proportions, and with its
      awnings, its fanciful chairs, its cushions and rugs, its view of the
      ocean, close at hand, tumbling along the base of the low cliffs whose
      level tops intervened in lawnlike smoothness, it formed a charming
      complement to the drawing room. As such it was in course of use at the
      present moment; it was occupied by a social circle. There were several
      ladies and two or three gentlemen, to whom Mrs. Westgate proceeded to
      introduce the distinguished strangers. She mentioned a great many names
      very freely and distinctly; the young Englishmen, shuffling about and
      bowing, were rather bewildered. But at last they were provided with chairs&mdash;low,
      wicker chairs, gilded, and tied with a great many ribbons&mdash;and one of
      the ladies (a very young person, with a little snub nose and several
      dimples) offered Percy Beaumont a fan. The fan was also adorned with pink
      love knots; but Percy Beaumont declined it, although he was very hot.
      Presently, however, it became cooler; the breeze from the sea was
      delicious, the view was charming, and the people sitting there looked
      exceedingly fresh and comfortable. Several of the ladies seemed to be
      young girls, and the gentlemen were slim, fair youths, such as our friends
      had seen the day before in New York. The ladies were working upon bands of
      tapestry, and one of the young men had an open book in his lap. Beaumont
      afterward learned from one of the ladies that this young man had been
      reading aloud, that he was from Boston and was very fond of reading aloud.
      Beaumont said it was a great pity that they had interrupted him; he should
      like so much (from all he had heard) to hear a Bostonian read. Couldn&rsquo;t
      the young man be induced to go on?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said his informant very freely; &ldquo;he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get the
      young ladies to attend to him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something very friendly, Beaumont perceived, in the attitude of
      the company; they looked at the young Englishmen with an air of animated
      sympathy and interest; they smiled, brightly and unanimously, at
      everything either of the visitors said. Lord Lambeth and his companion
      felt that they were being made very welcome. Mrs. Westgate seated herself
      between them, and, talking a great deal to each, they had occasion to
      observe that she was as pretty as their friend Littledale had promised.
      She was thirty years old, with the eyes and the smile of a girl of
      seventeen, and she was extremely light and graceful, elegant, exquisite.
      Mrs. Westgate was extremely spontaneous. She was very frank and
      demonstrative and appeared always&mdash;while she looked at you
      delightedly with her beautiful young eyes&mdash;to be making sudden
      confessions and concessions, after momentary hesitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall expect to see a great deal of you,&rdquo; she said to Lord Lambeth
      with a kind of joyous earnestness. &ldquo;We are very fond of Englishmen here;
      that is, there are a great many we have been fond of. After a day or two
      you must come and stay with us; we hope you will stay a long time.
      Newport&rsquo;s a very nice place when you come really to know it, when you know
      plenty of people. Of course you and Mr. Beaumont will have no difficulty
      about that. Englishmen are very well received here; there are almost
      always two or three of them about. I think they always like it, and I must
      say I should think they would. They receive ever so much attention. I must
      say I think they sometimes get spoiled; but I am sure you and Mr. Beaumont
      are proof against that. My husband tells me you are a friend of Captain
      Littledale; he was such a charming man. He made himself most agreeable
      here, and I am sure I wonder he didn&rsquo;t stay. It couldn&rsquo;t have been
      pleasanter for him in his own country, though, I suppose, it is very
      pleasant in England, for English people. I don&rsquo;t know myself; I have been
      there very little. I have been a great deal abroad, but I am always on the
      Continent. I must say I&rsquo;m extremely fond of Paris; you know we Americans
      always are; we go there when we die. Did you ever hear that before? That
      was said by a great wit, I mean the good Americans; but we are all good;
      you&rsquo;ll see that for yourself. All I know of England is London, and all I
      know of London is that place on that little corner, you know, where you
      buy jackets&mdash;jackets with that coarse braid and those big buttons.
      They make very good jackets in London, I will do you the justice to say
      that. And some people like the hats; but about the hats I was always a
      heretic; I always got my hats in Paris. You can&rsquo;t wear an English hat&mdash;at
      least I never could&mdash;unless you dress your hair a l&rsquo;Anglaise; and I
      must say that is a talent I have never possessed. In Paris they will make
      things to suit your peculiarities; but in England I think you like much
      more to have&mdash;how shall I say it?&mdash;one thing for everybody. I
      mean as regards dress. I don&rsquo;t know about other things; but I have always
      supposed that in other things everything was different. I mean according
      to the people&mdash;according to the classes, and all that. I am afraid
      you will think that I don&rsquo;t take a very favorable view; but you know you
      can&rsquo;t take a very favorable view in Dover Street in the month of November.
      That has always been my fate. Do you know Jones&rsquo;s Hotel in Dover Street?
      That&rsquo;s all I know of England. Of course everyone admits that the English
      hotels are your weak point. There was always the most frightful fog; I
      couldn&rsquo;t see to try my things on. When I got over to America&mdash;into
      the light&mdash;I usually found they were twice too big. The next time I
      mean to go in the season; I think I shall go next year. I want very much
      to take my sister; she has never been to England. I don&rsquo;t know whether you
      know what I mean by saying that the Englishmen who come here sometimes get
      spoiled. I mean that they take things as a matter of course&mdash;things
      that are done for them. Now, naturally, they are only a matter of course
      when the Englishmen are very nice. But, of course, they are almost always
      very nice. Of course this isn&rsquo;t nearly such an interesting country as
      England; there are not nearly so many things to see, and we haven&rsquo;t your
      country life. I have never seen anything of your country life; when I am
      in Europe I am always on the Continent. But I have heard a great deal
      about it; I know that when you are among yourselves in the country you
      have the most beautiful time. Of course we have nothing of that sort, we
      have nothing on that scale. I don&rsquo;t apologize, Lord Lambeth; some
      Americans are always apologizing; you must have noticed that. We have the
      reputation of always boasting and bragging and waving the American flag;
      but I must say that what strikes me is that we are perpetually making
      excuses and trying to smooth things over. The American flag has quite gone
      out of fashion; it&rsquo;s very carefully folded up, like an old tablecloth. Why
      should we apologize? The English never apologize&mdash;do they? No; I must
      say I never apologize. You must take us as we come&mdash;with all our
      imperfections on our heads. Of course we haven&rsquo;t your country life, and
      your old ruins, and your great estates, and your leisure class, and all
      that. But if we haven&rsquo;t, I should think you might find it a pleasant
      change&mdash;I think any country is pleasant where they have pleasant
      manners. Captain Littledale told me he had never seen such pleasant
      manners as at Newport, and he had been a great deal in European society.
      Hadn&rsquo;t he been in the diplomatic service? He told me the dream of his life
      was to get appointed to a diplomatic post in Washington. But he doesn&rsquo;t
      seem to have succeeded. I suppose that in England promotion&mdash;and all
      that sort of thing&mdash;is fearfully slow. With us, you know, it&rsquo;s a
      great deal too fast. You see, I admit our drawbacks. But I must confess I
      think Newport is an ideal place. I don&rsquo;t know anything like it anywhere.
      Captain Littledale told me he didn&rsquo;t know anything like it anywhere. It&rsquo;s
      entirely different from most watering places; it&rsquo;s a most charming life. I
      must say I think that when one goes to a foreign country one ought to
      enjoy the differences. Of course there are differences, otherwise what did
      one come abroad for? Look for your pleasure in the differences, Lord
      Lambeth; that&rsquo;s the way to do it; and then I am sure you will find
      American society&mdash;at least Newport society&mdash;most charming and
      most interesting. I wish very much my husband were here; but he&rsquo;s
      dreadfully confined to New York. I suppose you think that is very strange&mdash;for
      a gentleman. But you see we haven&rsquo;t any leisure class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westgate&rsquo;s discourse, delivered in a soft, sweet voice, flowed on
      like a miniature torrent, and was interrupted by a hundred little smiles,
      glances, and gestures, which might have figured the irregularities and
      obstructions of such a stream. Lord Lambeth listened to her with, it must
      be confessed, a rather ineffectual attention, although he indulged in a
      good many little murmurs and ejaculations of assent and deprecation. He
      had no great faculty for apprehending generalizations. There were some
      three or four indeed which, in the play of his own intelligence, he had
      originated, and which had seemed convenient at the moment; but at the
      present time he could hardly have been said to follow Mrs. Westgate as she
      darted gracefully about in the sea of speculation. Fortunately she asked
      for no especial rejoinder, for she looked about at the rest of the company
      as well, and smiled at Percy Beaumont, on the other side of her, as if he
      too much understand her and agree with her. He was rather more successful
      than his companion; for besides being, as we know, cleverer, his attention
      was not vaguely distracted by close vicinity to a remarkably interesting
      young girl, with dark hair and blue eyes. This was the case with Lord
      Lambeth, to whom it occurred after a while that the young girl with blue
      eyes and dark hair was the pretty sister of whom Mrs. Westgate had spoken.
      She presently turned to him with a remark which established her identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great pity you couldn&rsquo;t have brought my brother-in-law with you.
      It&rsquo;s a great shame he should be in New York in these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; it&rsquo;s so very hot,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be dreadful,&rdquo; said the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay he is very busy,&rdquo; Lord Lambeth observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentlemen in America work too much,&rdquo; the young girl went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do they? I daresay they like it,&rdquo; said her interlocutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it. One never sees them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you, really?&rdquo; asked Lord Lambeth. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have fancied that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you come to study American manners?&rdquo; asked the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I just came over for a lark. I haven&rsquo;t got long.&rdquo; Here
      there was a pause, and Lord Lambeth began again. &ldquo;But Mr. Westgate will
      come down here, will not he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly hope he will. He must help to entertain you and Mr.
      Beaumont.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lambeth looked at her a little with his handsome brown eyes. &ldquo;Do you
      suppose he would have come down with us if we had urged him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Westgate&rsquo;s sister-in-law was silent a moment, and then, &ldquo;I daresay he
      would,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; said the young Englishman. &ldquo;He was immensely civil to Beaumont
      and me,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a dear good fellow,&rdquo; the young lady rejoined, &ldquo;and he is a perfect
      husband. But all Americans are that,&rdquo; she continued, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; Lord Lambeth exclaimed again and wondered whether all American
      ladies had such a passion for generalizing as these two.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat there a good while: there was a great deal of talk; it was all very
      friendly and lively and jolly. Everyone present, sooner or later, said
      something to him, and seemed to make a particular point of addressing him
      by name. Two or three other persons came in, and there was a shifting of
      seats and changing of places; the gentlemen all entered into intimate
      conversation with the two Englishmen, made them urgent offers of
      hospitality, and hoped they might frequently be of service to them. They
      were afraid Lord Lambeth and Mr. Beaumont were not very comfortable at
      their hotel; that it was not, as one of them said, &ldquo;so private as those
      dear little English inns of yours.&rdquo; This last gentleman went on to say
      that unfortunately, as yet, perhaps, privacy was not quite so easily
      obtained in America as might be desired; still, he continued, you could
      generally get it by paying for it; in fact, you could get everything in
      America nowadays by paying for it. American life was certainly growing a
      great deal more private; it was growing very much like England. Everything
      at Newport, for instance, was thoroughly private; Lord Lambeth would
      probably be struck with that. It was also represented to the strangers
      that it mattered very little whether their hotel was agreeable, as
      everyone would want them to make visits; they would stay with other
      people, and, in any case, they would be a great deal at Mrs. Westgate&rsquo;s.
      They would find that very charming; it was the pleasantest house in
      Newport. It was a pity Mr. Westgate was always away; he was a man of the
      highest ability&mdash;very acute, very acute. He worked like a horse, and
      he left his wife&mdash;well, to do about as she liked. He liked her to
      enjoy herself, and she seemed to know how. She was extremely brilliant and
      a splendid talker. Some people preferred her sister; but Miss Alden was
      very different; she was in a different style altogether. Some people even
      thought her prettier, and, certainly, she was not so sharp. She was more
      in the Boston style; she had lived a great deal in Boston, and she was
      very highly educated. Boston girls, it was propounded, were more like
      English young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lambeth had presently a chance to test the truth of this proposition,
      for on the company rising in compliance with a suggestion from their
      hostess that they should walk down to the rocks and look at the sea, the
      young Englishman again found himself, as they strolled across the grass,
      in proximity to Mrs. Westgate&rsquo;s sister. Though she was but a girl of
      twenty, she appeared to feel the obligation to exert an active
      hospitality; and this was, perhaps, the more to be noticed as she seemed
      by nature a reserved and retiring person, and had little of her sister&rsquo;s
      fraternizing quality. She was perhaps rather too thin, and she was a
      little pale; but as she moved slowly over the grass, with her arms hanging
      at her sides, looking gravely for a moment at the sea and then brightly,
      for all her gravity, at him, Lord Lambeth thought her at least as pretty
      as Mrs. Westgate, and reflected that if this was the Boston style the
      Boston style was very charming. He thought she looked very clever; he
      could imagine that she was highly educated; but at the same time she
      seemed gentle and graceful. For all her cleverness, however, he felt that
      she had to think a little what to say; she didn&rsquo;t say the first thing that
      came into her head; he had come from a different part of the world and
      from a different society, and she was trying to adapt her conversation.
      The others were scattering themselves near the rocks; Mrs. Westgate had
      charge of Percy Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very jolly place, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very jolly place
      to sit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very charming,&rdquo; said the young girl. &ldquo;I often sit here; there are all
      kinds of cozy corners&mdash;as if they had been made on purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I suppose you have had some of them made,&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Alden looked at him a moment. &ldquo;Oh no, we have had nothing made. It&rsquo;s
      pure nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you would have a few little benches&mdash;rustic seats and
      that sort of thing. It might be so jolly to sit here, you know,&rdquo; Lord
      Lambeth went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid we haven&rsquo;t so many of those things as you,&rdquo; said the young
      girl thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay you go in for pure nature, as you were saying. Nature over here
      must be so grand, you know.&rdquo; And Lord Lambeth looked about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little coast line hereabouts was very pretty, but it was not at all
      grand, and Miss Alden appeared to rise to a perception of this fact. &ldquo;I am
      afraid it seems to you very rough,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like the coast
      scenery in Kingsley&rsquo;s novels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the novels always overdo it, you know,&rdquo; Lord Lambeth rejoined. &ldquo;You
      must not go by the novels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were wandering about a little on the rocks, and they stopped and
      looked down into a narrow chasm where the rising tide made a curious
      bellowing sound. It was loud enough to prevent their hearing each other,
      and they stood there for some moments in silence. The young girl looked at
      her companion, observing him attentively, but covertly, as women, even
      when very young, know how to do. Lord Lambeth repaid observation; tall,
      straight, and strong, he was handsome as certain young Englishmen, and
      certain young Englishmen almost alone, are handsome; with a perfect finish
      of feature and a look of intellectual repose and gentle good temper which
      seemed somehow to be consequent upon his well-cut nose and chin. And to
      speak of Lord Lambeth&rsquo;s expression of intellectual repose is not simply a
      civil way of saying that he looked stupid. He was evidently not a young
      man of an irritable imagination; he was not, as he would himself have
      said, tremendously clever; but though there was a kind of appealing
      dullness in his eye, he looked thoroughly reasonable and competent, and
      his appearance proclaimed that to be a nobleman, an athlete, and an
      excellent fellow was a sufficiently brilliant combination of qualities.
      The young girl beside him, it may be attested without further delay,
      thought him the handsomest young man she had ever seen; and Bessie Alden&rsquo;s
      imagination, unlike that of her companion, was irritable. He, however, was
      also making up his mind that she was uncommonly pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay it&rsquo;s very gay here, that you have lots of balls and parties,&rdquo;
       he said; for, if he was not tremendously clever, he rather prided himself
      on having, with women, a sufficiency of conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, there is a great deal going on,&rdquo; Bessie Alden replied. &ldquo;There
      are not so many balls, but there are a good many other things. You will
      see for yourself; we live rather in the midst of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you to say that. But I thought you Americans were
      always dancing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we dance a good deal; but I have never seen much of it. We
      don&rsquo;t do it much, at any rate, in summer. And I am sure,&rdquo; said Bessie
      Alden, &ldquo;that we don&rsquo;t have so many balls as you have in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Lambeth. &ldquo;Ah, in England it all depends, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not think much of our gaieties,&rdquo; said the young girl, looking at
      him with a little mixture of interrogation and decision which was peculiar
      to her. The interrogation seemed earnest and the decision seemed arch; but
      the mixture, at any rate, was charming. &ldquo;Those things, with us, are much
      less splendid than in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy you don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you I mean everything I say,&rdquo; the young girl declared.
      &ldquo;Certainly, from what I have read about English society, it is very
      different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah well, you know,&rdquo; said her companion, &ldquo;those things are often described
      by fellows who know nothing about them. You mustn&rsquo;t mind what you read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I <i>shall</i> mind what I read!&rdquo; Bessie Alden rejoined. &ldquo;When I read
      Thackeray and George Eliot, how can I help minding them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah well, Thackeray, and George Eliot,&rdquo; said the young nobleman; &ldquo;I
      haven&rsquo;t read much of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you suppose they know about society?&rdquo; asked Bessie Alden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I daresay they know; they were so very clever. But these fashionable
      novels,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth, &ldquo;they are awful rot, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His companion looked at him a moment with her dark blue eyes, and then she
      looked down in the chasm where the water was tumbling about. &ldquo;Do you mean
      Mrs. Gore, for instance?&rdquo; she said presently, raising her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I haven&rsquo;t read that, either,&rdquo; was the young man&rsquo;s rejoinder,
      laughing a little and blushing. &ldquo;I am afraid you&rsquo;ll think I am not very
      intellectual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reading Mrs. Gore is no proof of intellect. But I like reading everything
      about English life&mdash;even poor books. I am so curious about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t ladies always curious?&rdquo; asked the young man jestingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bessie Alden appeared to desire to answer his question seriously. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t think so&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think we are enough so&mdash;that we care
      about many things. So it&rsquo;s all the more of a compliment,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;that
      I should want to know so much about England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The logic here seemed a little close; but Lord Lambeth, made conscious of
      a compliment, found his natural modesty just at hand. &ldquo;I am sure you know
      a great deal more than I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really think I know a great deal&mdash;for a person who has never been
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you really never been there?&rdquo; cried Lord Lambeth. &ldquo;Fancy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never&mdash;except in imagination,&rdquo; said the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy!&rdquo; repeated her companion. &ldquo;But I daresay you&rsquo;ll go soon, won&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the dream of my life!&rdquo; declared Bessie Alden, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your sister seems to know a tremendous lot about London,&rdquo; Lord
      Lambeth went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl was silent a moment. &ldquo;My sister and I are two very
      different persons,&rdquo; she presently said. &ldquo;She has been a great deal in
      Europe. She has been in England several times. She has known a great many
      English people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must have known some, too,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that I have ever spoken to one before. You are the first
      Englishman that&mdash;to my knowledge&mdash;I have ever talked with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bessie Alden made this statement with a certain gravity&mdash;almost, as
      it seemed to Lord Lambeth, an impressiveness. Attempts at impressiveness
      always made him feel awkward, and he now began to laugh and swing his
      stick. &ldquo;Ah, you would have been sure to know!&rdquo; he said. And then he added,
      after an instant, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I am not a better specimen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl looked away; but she smiled, laying aside her
      impressiveness. &ldquo;You must remember that you are only a beginning,&rdquo; she
      said. Then she retraced her steps, leading the way back to the lawn, where
      they saw Mrs. Westgate come toward them with Percy Beaumont still at her
      side. &ldquo;Perhaps I shall go to England next year,&rdquo; Miss Alden continued; &ldquo;I
      want to, immensely. My sister is going to Europe, and she has asked me to
      go with her. If we go, I shall make her stay as long as possible in
      London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you must come in July,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the time when
      there is most going on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can wait till July,&rdquo; the young girl rejoined. &ldquo;By the
      first of May I shall be very impatient.&rdquo; They had gone further, and Mrs.
      Westgate and her companion were near them. &ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; said Miss Alden, &ldquo;I
      have given out that we are going to London next May. So please to conduct
      yourself accordingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Percy Beaumont wore a somewhat animated&mdash;even a slightly irritated&mdash;air.
      He was by no means so handsome a man as his cousin, although in his
      cousin&rsquo;s absence he might have passed for a striking specimen of the tall,
      muscular, fair-bearded, clear-eyed Englishman. Just now Beaumont&rsquo;s clear
      eyes, which were small and of a pale gray color, had a rather troubled
      light, and, after glancing at Bessie Alden while she spoke, he rested them
      upon his kinsman. Mrs. Westgate meanwhile, with her superfluously pretty
      gaze, looked at everyone alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better wait till the time comes,&rdquo; she said to her sister.
      &ldquo;Perhaps next May you won&rsquo;t care so much about London. Mr. Beaumont and
      I,&rdquo; she went on, smiling at her companion, &ldquo;have had a tremendous
      discussion. We don&rsquo;t agree about anything. It&rsquo;s perfectly delightful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say, Percy!&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I disagree,&rdquo; said Beaumont, stroking down his back hair, &ldquo;even to the
      point of not thinking it delightful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; cried Lord Lambeth again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything delightful in my disagreeing with Mrs. Westgate,&rdquo;
       said Percy Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do!&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate declared; and she turned to her sister. &ldquo;You
      know you have to go to town. The phaeton is there. You had better take
      Lord Lambeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point Percy Beaumont certainly looked straight at his kinsman; he
      tried to catch his eye. But Lord Lambeth would not look at him; his own
      eyes were better occupied. &ldquo;I shall be very happy,&rdquo; cried Bessie Alden. &ldquo;I
      am only going to some shops. But I will drive you about and show you the
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An American woman who respects herself,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate, turning to
      Beaumont with her bright expository air, &ldquo;must buy something every day of
      her life. If she can not do it herself, she must send out some member of
      her family for the purpose. So Bessie goes forth to fulfill my mission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl had walked away, with Lord Lambeth by her side, to whom she
      was talking still; and Percy Beaumont watched them as they passed toward
      the house. &ldquo;She fulfills her own mission,&rdquo; he presently said; &ldquo;that of
      being a very attractive young lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I should say very attractive,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate rejoined.
      &ldquo;She is not so much that as she is charming when you really know her. She
      is very shy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extremely shy,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate repeated. &ldquo;But she is a dear good girl; she
      is a charming species of girl. She is not in the least a flirt; that isn&rsquo;t
      at all her line; she doesn&rsquo;t know the alphabet of that sort of thing. She
      is very simple, very serious. She has lived a great deal in Boston, with
      another sister of mine&mdash;the eldest of us&mdash;who married a
      Bostonian. She is very cultivated, not at all like me; I am not in the
      least cultivated. She has studied immensely and read everything; she is
      what they call in Boston &lsquo;thoughtful.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rum sort of girl for Lambeth to get hold of!&rdquo; his lordship&rsquo;s kinsman
      privately reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really believe,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate continued, &ldquo;that the most charming girl
      in the world is a Boston superstructure upon a New York fonds; or perhaps
      a New York superstructure upon a Boston fonds. At any rate, it&rsquo;s the
      mixture,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate, who continued to give Percy Beaumont a great
      deal of information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lambeth got into a little basket phaeton with Bessie Alden, and she
      drove him down the long avenue, whose extent he had measured on foot a
      couple of hours before, into the ancient town, as it was called in that
      part of the world, of Newport. The ancient town was a curious affair&mdash;a
      collection of fresh-looking little wooden houses, painted white, scattered
      over a hillside and clustered about a long straight street paved with
      enormous cobblestones. There were plenty of shops&mdash;a large proportion
      of which appeared to be those of fruit vendors, with piles of huge
      watermelons and pumpkins stacked in front of them; and, drawn up before
      the shops, or bumping about on the cobblestones, were innumerable other
      basket phaetons freighted with ladies of high fashion, who greeted each
      other from vehicle to vehicle and conversed on the edge of the pavement in
      a manner that struck Lord Lambeth as demonstrative, with a great many &ldquo;Oh,
      my dears,&rdquo; and little quick exclamations and caresses. His companion went
      into seventeen shops&mdash;he amused himself with counting them&mdash;and
      accumulated at the bottom of the phaeton a pile of bundles that hardly
      left the young Englishman a place for his feet. As she had no groom nor
      footman, he sat in the phaeton to hold the ponies, where, although he was
      not a particularly acute observer, he saw much to entertain him&mdash;especially
      the ladies just mentioned, who wandered up and down with the appearance of
      a kind of aimless intentness, as if they were looking for something to
      buy, and who, tripping in and out of their vehicles, displayed remarkably
      pretty feet. It all seemed to Lord Lambeth very odd, and bright, and gay.
      Of course, before they got back to the villa, he had had a great deal of
      desultory conversation with Bessie Alden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Englishmen spent the whole of that day and the whole of many
      successive days in what the French call the intimite of their new friends.
      They agreed that it was extremely jolly, that they had never known
      anything more agreeable. It is not proposed to narrate minutely the
      incidents of their sojourn on this charming shore; though if it were
      convenient I might present a record of impressions nonetheless delectable
      that they were not exhaustively analyzed. Many of them still linger in the
      minds of our travelers, attended by a train of harmonious images&mdash;images
      of brilliant mornings on lawns and piazzas that overlooked the sea; of
      innumerable pretty girls; of infinite lounging and talking and laughing
      and flirting and lunching and dining; of universal friendliness and
      frankness; of occasions on which they knew everyone and everything and had
      an extraordinary sense of ease; of drives and rides in the late afternoon
      over gleaming beaches, on long sea roads, beneath a sky lighted up by
      marvelous sunsets; of suppers, on the return, informal, irregular,
      agreeable; of evenings at open windows or on the perpetual verandas, in
      the summer starlight, above the warm Atlantic. The young Englishmen were
      introduced to everybody, entertained by everybody, intimate with
      everybody. At the end of three days they had removed their luggage from
      the hotel and had gone to stay with Mrs. Westgate&mdash;a step to which
      Percy Beaumont at first offered some conscientious opposition. I call his
      opposition conscientious, because it was founded upon some talk that he
      had had, on the second day, with Bessie Alden. He had indeed had a good
      deal of talk with her, for she was not literally always in conversation
      with Lord Lambeth. He had meditated upon Mrs. Westgate&rsquo;s account of her
      sister, and he discovered for himself that the young lady was clever, and
      appeared to have read a great deal. She seemed very nice, though he could
      not make out, as Mrs. Westgate had said, she was shy. If she was shy, she
      carried it off very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Beaumont,&rdquo; she had said, &ldquo;please tell me something about Lord
      Lambeth&rsquo;s family. How would you say it in England&mdash;his position?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His position?&rdquo; Percy Beaumont repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His rank, or whatever you call it. Unfortunately we haven&rsquo;t got a <i>peerage</i>,
      like the people in Thackeray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great pity,&rdquo; said Beaumont. &ldquo;You would find it all set forth
      there so much better than I can do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a peer, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, he is a peer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And has he any other title than Lord Lambeth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His title is the Marquis of Lambeth,&rdquo; said Beaumont; and then he was
      silent. Bessie Alden appeared to be looking at him with interest. &ldquo;He is
      the son of the Duke of Bayswater,&rdquo; he added presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The eldest son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are his parents living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; if his father were not living he would be a duke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that when his father dies,&rdquo; pursued Bessie Alden with more simplicity
      than might have been expected in a clever girl, &ldquo;he will become Duke of
      Bayswater?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont. &ldquo;But his father is in excellent health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beaumont smiled a little. &ldquo;The duchess is uncommonly robust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And has he any sisters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there are two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are they called?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of them is married. She is the Countess of Pimlico.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other is unmarried; she is plain Lady Julia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bessie Alden looked at him a moment. &ldquo;Is she very plain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beaumont began to laugh again. &ldquo;You would not find her so handsome as her
      brother,&rdquo; he said; and it was after this that he attempted to dissuade the
      heir of the Duke of Bayswater from accepting Mrs. Westgate&rsquo;s invitation.
      &ldquo;Depend upon it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that girl means to try for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me you are doing your best to make a fool of me,&rdquo; the modest
      young nobleman answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has been asking me,&rdquo; said Beaumont, &ldquo;all about your people and your
      possessions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure it is very good of her!&rdquo; Lord Lambeth rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; observed his companion, &ldquo;if you go, you go with your eyes
      open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn my eyes!&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Lambeth. &ldquo;If one is to be a dozen times a
      day at the house, it is a great deal more convenient to sleep there. I am
      sick of traveling up and down this beastly avenue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Since he had determined to go, Percy Beaumont would, of course, have been
      very sorry to allow him to go alone; he was a man of conscience, and he
      remembered his promise to the duchess. It was obviously the memory of this
      promise that made him say to his companion a couple of days later that he
      rather wondered he should be so fond of that girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, how do you know how fond I am of her?&rdquo; asked Lord
      Lambeth. &ldquo;And, in the second place, why shouldn&rsquo;t I be fond of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think she would be in your line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you call my &lsquo;line&rsquo;? You don&rsquo;t set her down as &lsquo;fast&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so. Mrs. Westgate tells me that there is no such thing as the
      &lsquo;fast girl&rsquo; in America; that it&rsquo;s an English invention, and that the term
      has no meaning here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the better. It&rsquo;s an animal I detest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You prefer a bluestocking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that what you call Miss Alden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her sister tells me,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont, &ldquo;that she is tremendously
      literary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about that. She is certainly very clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Beaumont, &ldquo;I should have supposed you would have found that
      sort of thing awfully slow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In point of fact,&rdquo; Lord Lambeth rejoined, &ldquo;I find it uncommonly lively.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this, Percy Beaumont held his tongue; but on the 10th of August he
      wrote to the Duchess of Bayswater. He was, as I have said, a man of
      conscience, and he had a strong, incorruptible sense of the proprieties of
      life. His kinsman, meanwhile, was having a great deal of talk with Bessie
      Alden&mdash;on the red sea rocks beyond the lawn; in the course of long
      island rides, with a slow return in the glowing twilight; on the deep
      veranda late in the evening. Lord Lambeth, who had stayed at many houses,
      had never stayed at a house in which it was possible for a young man to
      converse so frequently with a young lady. This young lady no longer
      applied to Percy Beaumont for information concerning his lordship. She
      addressed herself directly to the young nobleman. She asked him a great
      many questions, some of which bored him a little; for he took no pleasure
      in talking about himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Lambeth,&rdquo; said Bessie Alden, &ldquo;are you a hereditary legislator?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; cried Lord Lambeth, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make me call myself such names as
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are a member of Parliament,&rdquo; said the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the sound of that, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you sit in the House of Lords?&rdquo; Bessie Alden went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very seldom,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it an important position?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it would be very grand,&rdquo; said Bessie Alden, &ldquo;to possess,
      simply by an accident of birth, the right to make laws for a great
      nation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but one doesn&rsquo;t make laws. It&rsquo;s a great humbug.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that,&rdquo; the young girl declared. &ldquo;It must be a great
      privilege, and I should think that if one thought of it in the right way&mdash;from
      a high point of view&mdash;it would be very inspiring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The less one thinks of it, the better,&rdquo; Lord Lambeth affirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s tremendous,&rdquo; said Bessie Alden; and on another occasion she
      asked him if he had any tenantry. Hereupon it was that, as I have said, he
      was a little bored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to buy up their leases?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have you got any livings?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Have you got a clergyman that is looking out?&rdquo; But
      she made him tell her that he had a castle; he confessed to but one. It
      was the place in which he had been born and brought up, and, as he had an
      old-time liking for it, he was beguiled into describing it a little and
      saying it was really very jolly. Bessie Alden listened with great interest
      and declared that she would give the world to see such a place. Whereupon&mdash;&ldquo;It
      would be awfully kind of you to come and stay there,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.
      He took a vague satisfaction in the circumstance that Percy Beaumont had
      not heard him make the remark I have just recorded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Westgate all this time had not, as they said at Newport, &ldquo;come on.&rdquo;
       His wife more than once announced that she expected him on the morrow; but
      on the morrow she wandered about a little, with a telegram in her jeweled
      fingers, declaring it was very tiresome that his business detained him in
      New York; that he could only hope the Englishmen were having a good time.
      &ldquo;I must say,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate, &ldquo;that it is no thanks to him if you
      are.&rdquo; And she went on to explain, while she continued that slow-paced
      promenade which enabled her well-adjusted skirts to display themselves so
      advantageously, that unfortunately in America there was no leisure class.
      It was Lord Lambeth&rsquo;s theory, freely propounded when the young men were
      together, that Percy Beaumont was having a very good time with Mrs.
      Westgate, and that, under the pretext of meeting for the purpose of
      animated discussion, they were indulging in practices that imparted a
      shade of hypocrisy to the lady&rsquo;s regret for her husband&rsquo;s absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you we are always discussing and differing,&rdquo; said Percy
      Beaumont. &ldquo;She is awfully argumentative. American ladies certainly don&rsquo;t
      mind contradicting you. Upon my word I don&rsquo;t think I was ever treated so
      by a woman before. She&rsquo;s so devilish positive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westgate&rsquo;s positive quality, however, evidently had its attractions,
      for Beaumont was constantly at his hostess&rsquo;s side. He detached himself one
      day to the extent of going to New York to talk over the Tennessee Central
      with Mr. Westgate; but he was absent only forty-eight hours, during which,
      with Mr. Westgate&rsquo;s assistance, he completely settled this piece of
      business. &ldquo;They certainly do things quickly in New York,&rdquo; he observed to
      his cousin; and he added that Mr. Westgate had seemed very uneasy lest his
      wife should miss her visitor&mdash;he had been in such an awful hurry to
      send him back to her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll never come up to an American
      husband, if that&rsquo;s what the wives expect,&rdquo; he said to Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westgate, however, was not to enjoy much longer the entertainment
      with which an indulgent husband had desired to keep her provided. On the
      21st of August Lord Lambeth received a telegram from his mother,
      requesting him to return immediately to England; his father had been taken
      ill, and it was his filial duty to come to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Englishman was visibly annoyed. &ldquo;What the deuce does it mean?&rdquo;
       he asked of his kinsman. &ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Percy Beaumont was annoyed as well; he had deemed it his duty, as I have
      narrated, to write to the duchess, but he had not expected that this
      distinguished woman would act so promptly upon his hint. &ldquo;It means,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;that your father is laid up. I don&rsquo;t suppose it&rsquo;s anything serious;
      but you have no option. Take the first steamer; but don&rsquo;t be alarmed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lambeth made his farewells; but the few last words that he exchanged
      with Bessie Alden are the only ones that have a place in our record. &ldquo;Of
      course I needn&rsquo;t assure you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that if you should come to England
      next year, I expect to be the first person that you inform of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bessie Alden looked at him a little, and she smiled. &ldquo;Oh, if we come to
      London,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I should think you would hear of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Percy Beaumont returned with his cousin, and his sense of duty compelled
      him, one windless afternoon, in mid-Atlantic, to say to Lord Lambeth that
      he suspected that the duchess&rsquo;s telegram was in part the result of
      something he himself had written to her. &ldquo;I wrote to her&mdash;as I
      explicitly notified you I had promised to do&mdash;that you were extremely
      interested in a little American girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lambeth was extremely angry, and he indulged for some moments in the
      simple language of indignation. But I have said that he was a reasonable
      young man, and I can give no better proof of it than the fact that he
      remarked to his companion at the end of half an hour, &ldquo;You were quite
      right, after all. I am very much interested in her. Only, to be fair,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;you should have told my mother also that she is not&mdash;seriously&mdash;interested
      in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Percy Beaumont gave a little laugh. &ldquo;There is nothing so charming as
      modesty in a young man in your position. That speech is a capital proof
      that you are sweet on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not interested&mdash;she is not!&rdquo; Lord Lambeth repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said his companion, &ldquo;you are very far gone.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      PART II
    </h2>
    <p>
      In point of fact, as Percy Beaumont would have said, Mrs. Westgate
      disembarked on the 18th of May on the British coast. She was accompanied
      by her sister, but she was not attended by any other member of her family.
      To the deprivation of her husband&rsquo;s society Mrs. Westgate was, however,
      habituated; she had made half a dozen journeys to Europe without him, and
      she now accounted for his absence, to interrogative friends on this side
      of the Atlantic, by allusion to the regrettable but conspicuous fact that
      in America there was no leisure class. The two ladies came up to London
      and alighted at Jones&rsquo;s Hotel, where Mrs. Westgate, who had made on former
      occasions the most agreeable impression at this establishment, received an
      obsequious greeting. Bessie Alden had felt much excited about coming to
      England; she had expected the &ldquo;associations&rdquo; would be very charming, that
      it would be an infinite pleasure to rest her eyes upon the things she had
      read about in the poets and historians. She was very fond of the poets and
      historians, of the picturesque, of the past, of retrospect, of mementos
      and reverberations of greatness; so that on coming into the English world,
      where strangeness and familiarity would go hand in hand, she was prepared
      for a multitude of fresh emotions. They began very promptly&mdash;these
      tender, fluttering sensations; they began with the sight of the beautiful
      English landscape, whose dark richness was quickened and brightened by the
      season; with the carpeted fields and flowering hedgerows, as she looked at
      them from the window of the train; with the spires of the rural churches
      peeping above the rook-haunted treetops; with the oak-studded parks, the
      ancient homes, the cloudy light, the speech, the manners, the thousand
      differences. Mrs. Westgate&rsquo;s impressions had, of course, much less novelty
      and keenness, and she gave but a wandering attention to her sister&rsquo;s
      ejaculations and rhapsodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know my enjoyment of England is not so intellectual as Bessie&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she
      said to several of her friends in the course of her visit to this country.
      &ldquo;And yet if it is not intellectual, I can&rsquo;t say it is physical. I don&rsquo;t
      think I can quite say what it is, my enjoyment of England.&rdquo; When once it
      was settled that the two ladies should come abroad and should spend a few
      weeks in England on their way to the Continent, they of course exchanged a
      good many allusions to their London acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will certainly be much nicer having friends there,&rdquo; Bessie Alden had
      said one day as she sat on the sunny deck of the steamer at her sister&rsquo;s
      feet on a large blue rug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom do you mean by friends?&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All those English gentlemen whom you have known and entertained. Captain
      Littledale, for instance. And Lord Lambeth and Mr. Beaumont,&rdquo; added Bessie
      Alden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you expect them to give us a very grand reception?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bessie reflected a moment; she was addicted, as we know, to reflection.
      &ldquo;Well, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor, sweet child,&rdquo; murmured her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I said that is so silly?&rdquo; asked Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a little too simple; just a little. It is very becoming, but it
      pleases people at your expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am certainly too simple to understand you,&rdquo; said Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell you a story?&rdquo; asked her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would be so good. That is what they do to amuse simple people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westgate consulted her memory, while her companion sat gazing at the
      shining sea. &ldquo;Did you ever hear of the Duke of Green-Erin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; said Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s no matter,&rdquo; her sister went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a proof of my simplicity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My story is meant to illustrate that of some other people,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Westgate. &ldquo;The Duke of Green-Erin is what they call in England a great
      swell, and some five years ago he came to America. He spent most of his
      time in New York, and in New York he spent his days and his nights at the
      Butterworths&rsquo;. You have heard, at least, of the Butterworths. <i>Bien</i>.
      They did everything in the world for him&mdash;they turned themselves
      inside out. They gave him a dozen dinner parties and balls and were the
      means of his being invited to fifty more. At first he used to come into
      Mrs. Butterworth&rsquo;s box at the opera in a tweed traveling suit; but someone
      stopped that. At any rate, he had a beautiful time, and they parted the
      best friends in the world. Two years elapse, and the Butterworths come
      abroad and go to London. The first thing they see in all the papers&mdash;in
      England those things are in the most prominent place&mdash;is that the
      Duke of Green-Erin has arrived in town for the Season. They wait a little,
      and then Mr. Butterworth&mdash;as polite as ever&mdash;goes and leaves a
      card. They wait a little more; the visit is not returned; they wait three
      weeks&mdash;silence de mort&mdash;the Duke gives no sign. The Butterworths
      see a lot of other people, put down the Duke of Green-Erin as a rude,
      ungrateful man, and forget all about him. One fine day they go to Ascot
      Races, and there they meet him face to face. He stares a moment and then
      comes up to Mr. Butterworth, taking something from his pocketbook&mdash;something
      which proves to be a banknote. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you, Mr. Butterworth,&rsquo; he
      says, &lsquo;so that I can pay you that ten pounds I lost to you in New York. I
      saw the other day you remembered our bet; here are the ten pounds, Mr.
      Butterworth. Goodbye, Mr. Butterworth.&rsquo; And off he goes, and that&rsquo;s the
      last they see of the Duke of Green-Erin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your story?&rdquo; asked Bessie Alden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s interesting?&rdquo; her sister replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Westgate, &ldquo;you are not so simple after all! Believe it or
      not, as you please; there is no smoke without fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the way,&rdquo; asked Bessie after a moment, &ldquo;that you expect your
      friends to treat you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I defy them to treat me very ill, because I shall not give them the
      opportunity. With the best will in the world, in that case they can&rsquo;t be
      very offensive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bessie Alden was silent a moment. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what makes you talk that
      way,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The English are a great people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly; and that is just the way they have grown great&mdash;by dropping
      you when you have ceased to be useful. People say they are not clever; but
      I think they are very clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know you have liked them&mdash;all the Englishmen you have seen,&rdquo;
       said Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have liked me,&rdquo; her sister rejoined; &ldquo;it would be more correct to
      say that. And, of course, one likes that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bessie Alden resumed for some moments her studies in sea green. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;whether they like me or not, I mean to like them. And happily,&rdquo;
       she added, &ldquo;Lord Lambeth does not owe me ten pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the first few days after their arrival at Jones&rsquo;s Hotel our
      charming Americans were much occupied with what they would have called
      looking about them. They found occasion to make a large number of
      purchases, and their opportunities for conversation were such only as were
      offered by the deferential London shopmen. Bessie Alden, even in driving
      from the station, took an immense fancy to the British metropolis, and at
      the risk of exhibiting her as a young woman of vulgar tastes it must be
      recorded that for a considerable period she desired no higher pleasure
      than to drive about the crowded streets in a hansom cab. To her attentive
      eyes they were full of a strange picturesque life, and it is at least
      beneath the dignity of our historic muse to enumerate the trivial objects
      and incidents which this simple young lady from Boston found so
      entertaining. It may be freely mentioned, however, that whenever, after a
      round of visits in Bond Street and Regent Street, she was about to return
      with her sister to Jones&rsquo;s Hotel, she made an earnest request that they
      should be driven home by way of Westminster Abbey. She had begun by asking
      whether it would not be possible to take the Tower on the way to their
      lodgings; but it happened that at a more primitive stage of her culture
      Mrs. Westgate had paid a visit to this venerable monument, which she spoke
      of ever afterward vaguely as a dreadful disappointment; so that she
      expressed the liveliest disapproval of any attempt to combine historical
      researches with the purchase of hairbrushes and notepaper. The most she
      would consent to do in this line was to spend half an hour at Madame
      Tussaud&rsquo;s, where she saw several dusty wax effigies of members of the
      royal family. She told Bessie that if she wished to go to the Tower she
      must get someone else to take her. Bessie expressed hereupon an earnest
      disposition to go alone; but upon this proposal as well Mrs. Westgate
      sprinkled cold water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you are not in your innocent little Boston. It
      is not a question of walking up and down Beacon Street.&rdquo; Then she went on
      to explain that there were two classes of American girls in Europe&mdash;those
      that walked about alone and those that did not. &ldquo;You happen to belong, my
      dear,&rdquo; she said to her sister, &ldquo;to the class that does not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only,&rdquo; answered Bessie, laughing, &ldquo;because you happen to prevent
      me.&rdquo; And she devoted much private meditation to this question of effecting
      a visit to the Tower of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly it seemed as if the problem might be solved; the two ladies at
      Jones&rsquo;s Hotel received a visit from Willie Woodley. Such was the social
      appellation of a young American who had sailed from New York a few days
      after their own departure, and who, having the privilege of intimacy with
      them in that city, had lost no time, on his arrival in London, in coming
      to pay them his respects. He had, in fact, gone to see them directly after
      going to see his tailor, than which there can be no greater exhibition of
      promptitude on the part of a young American who has just alighted at the
      Charing Cross Hotel. He was a slim, pale youth, of the most amiable
      disposition, famous for the skill with which he led the &ldquo;German&rdquo; in New
      York. Indeed, by the young ladies who habitually figured in this
      Terpsichorean revel he was believed to be &ldquo;the best dancer in the world&rdquo;;
      it was in these terms that he was always spoken of, and that his identity
      was indicated. He was the gentlest, softest young man it was possible to
      meet; he was beautifully dressed&mdash;&ldquo;in the English style&rdquo;&mdash;and he
      knew an immense deal about London. He had been at Newport during the
      previous summer, at the time of our young Englishmen&rsquo;s visit, and he took
      extreme pleasure in the society of Bessie Alden, whom he always addressed
      as &ldquo;Miss Bessie.&rdquo; She immediately arranged with him, in the presence of
      her sister, that he should conduct her to the scene of Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s
      execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may do as you please,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate. &ldquo;Only&mdash;if you desire
      the information&mdash;it is not the custom here for young ladies to knock
      about London with young men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Bessie has waltzed with me so often,&rdquo; observed Willie Woodley; &ldquo;she
      can surely go out with me in a hansom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consider waltzing,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate, &ldquo;the most innocent pleasure of
      our time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a compliment to our time!&rdquo; exclaimed the young man with a little
      laugh, in spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why I should regard what is done here,&rdquo; said Bessie Alden.
      &ldquo;Why should I suffer the restrictions of a society of which I enjoy none
      of the privileges?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very good&mdash;very good,&rdquo; murmured Willie Woodley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go to the Tower, and feel the ax, if you like,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate.
      &ldquo;I consent to your going with Mr. Woodley; but I should not let you go
      with an Englishman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Bessie wouldn&rsquo;t care to go with an Englishman!&rdquo; Mr. Woodley declared
      with a faint asperity that was, perhaps, not unnatural in a young man,
      who, dressing in the manner that I have indicated and knowing a great
      deal, as I have said, about London, saw no reason for drawing these sharp
      distinctions. He agreed upon a day with Miss Bessie&mdash;a day of that
      same week.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ingenious mind might, perhaps, trace a connection between the young
      girl&rsquo;s allusion to her destitution of social privileges and a question she
      asked on the morrow as she sat with her sister at lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mean to write to&mdash;to anyone?&rdquo; said Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote this morning to Captain Littledale,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mr. Woodley said that Captain Littledale had gone to India.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he thought he had heard so; he knew nothing about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Bessie Alden said nothing more; then, at last, &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you
      intend to write to&mdash;to Mr. Beaumont?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to Lord Lambeth,&rdquo; said her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said Mr. Beaumont because he was so good a friend of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westgate looked at the young girl with sisterly candor. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care
      two straws for Mr. Beaumont.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were certainly very nice to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am nice to everyone,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To everyone but me,&rdquo; rejoined Bessie, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sister continued to look at her; then, at last, &ldquo;Are you in love with
      Lord Lambeth?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl stared a moment, and the question was apparently too
      humorous even to make her blush. &ldquo;Not that I know of,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because if you are,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate went on, &ldquo;I shall certainly not send
      for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That proves what I said,&rdquo; declared Bessie, smiling&mdash;&ldquo;that you are
      not nice to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a poor service, my dear child,&rdquo; said her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what sense? There is nothing against Lord Lambeth that I know of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westgate was silent a moment. &ldquo;You <i>are</i> in love with him then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bessie stared again; but this time she blushed a little. &ldquo;Ah! if you won&rsquo;t
      be serious,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;we will not mention him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some moments Lord Lambeth was not mentioned again, and it was Mrs.
      Westgate who, at the end of this period, reverted to him. &ldquo;Of course I
      will let him know we are here, because I think he would be hurt&mdash;justly
      enough&mdash;if we should go away without seeing him. It is fair to give
      him a chance to come and thank me for the kindness we showed him. But I
      don&rsquo;t want to seem eager.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; said Bessie with a little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though I confess,&rdquo; added her sister, &ldquo;that I am curious to see how he
      will behave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He behaved very well at Newport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Newport is not London. At Newport he could do as he liked; but here it is
      another affair. He has to have an eye to consequences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he had more freedom, then, at Newport,&rdquo; argued Bessie, &ldquo;it is the more
      to his credit that he behaved well; and if he has to be so careful here,
      it is possible he will behave even better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better&mdash;better,&rdquo; repeated her sister. &ldquo;My dear child, what is your
      point of view?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean&mdash;my point of view?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you care for Lord Lambeth&mdash;a little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time Bessie Alden was displeased; she slowly got up from the table,
      turning her face away from her sister. &ldquo;You will oblige me by not talking
      so,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westgate sat watching her for some moments as she moved slowly about
      the room and went and stood at the window. &ldquo;I will write to him this
      afternoon,&rdquo; she said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do as you please!&rdquo; Bessie answered; and presently she turned round. &ldquo;I am
      not afraid to say that I like Lord Lambeth. I like him very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not clever,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there have been clever people whom I have disliked,&rdquo; said Bessie
      Alden; &ldquo;so that I suppose I may like a stupid one. Besides, Lord Lambeth
      is not stupid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so stupid as he looks!&rdquo; exclaimed her sister, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were in love with Lord Lambeth, as you said just now, it would be
      bad policy on your part to abuse him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, don&rsquo;t give me lessons in policy!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Westgate.
      &ldquo;The policy I mean to follow is very deep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl began to walk about the room again; then she stopped before
      her sister. &ldquo;I have never heard in the course of five minutes,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;so many hints and innuendoes. I wish you would tell me in plain English
      what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that you may be much annoyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is still only a hint,&rdquo; said Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sister looked at her, hesitating an instant. &ldquo;It will be said of you
      that you have come after Lord Lambeth&mdash;that you followed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bessie Alden threw back her pretty head like a startled hind, and a look
      flashed into her face that made Mrs. Westgate rise from her chair. &ldquo;Who
      says such things as that?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a very convenient faculty of doubt. But my policy will be, as I
      say, very deep. I shall leave you to find out this kind of thing for
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bessie fixed her eyes upon her sister, and Mrs. Westgate thought for a
      moment there were tears in them. &ldquo;Do they talk that way here?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see. I shall leave you alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me alone,&rdquo; said Bessie Alden. &ldquo;Take me away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I want to see what you make of it,&rdquo; her sister continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will understand after Lord Lambeth has come,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate with
      a little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two ladies had arranged that on this afternoon Willie Woodley should
      go with them to Hyde Park, where Bessie Alden expected to derive much
      entertainment from sitting on a little green chair, under the great trees,
      beside Rotten Row. The want of a suitable escort had hitherto rendered
      this pleasure inaccessible; but no escort now, for such an expedition,
      could have been more suitable than their devoted young countryman, whose
      mission in life, it might almost be said, was to find chairs for ladies,
      and who appeared on the stroke of half-past five with a white camellia in
      his buttonhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have written to Lord Lambeth, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate to her
      sister, on coming into the room where Bessie Alden, drawing on her long
      gray gloves, was entertaining their visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie said nothing, but Willie Woodley exclaimed that his lordship was in
      town; he had seen his name in the Morning Post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you read the Morning Post?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Westgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; it&rsquo;s great fun,&rdquo; Willie Woodley affirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want so to see it,&rdquo; said Bessie; &ldquo;there is so much about it in
      Thackeray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send it to you every morning,&rdquo; said Willie Woodley.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found them what Bessie Alden thought excellent places, under the great
      trees, beside the famous avenue whose humors had been made familiar to the
      young girl&rsquo;s childhood by the pictures in Punch. The day was bright and
      warm, and the crowd of riders and spectators, and the great procession of
      carriages, were proportionately dense and brilliant. The scene bore the
      stamp of the London Season at its height, and Bessie Alden found more
      entertainment in it than she was able to express to her companions. She
      sat silent, under her parasol, and her imagination, according to its wont,
      let itself loose into the great changing assemblage of striking and
      suggestive figures. They stirred up a host of old impressions and
      preconceptions, and she found herself fitting a history to this person and
      a theory to that, and making a place for them all in her little private
      museum of types. But if she said little, her sister on one side and Willie
      Woodley on the other expressed themselves in lively alternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that green dress with blue flounces,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate. &ldquo;Quelle
      toilette!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Marquis of Blackborough,&rdquo; said the young man&mdash;&ldquo;the one in
      the white coat. I heard him speak the other night in the House of Lords;
      it was something about ramrods; he called them &lsquo;wamwods.&rsquo; He&rsquo;s an awful
      swell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see anything like the way they are pinned back?&rdquo; Mrs.
      Westgate resumed. &ldquo;They never know where to stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do nothing but stop,&rdquo; said Willie Woodley. &ldquo;It prevents them from
      walking. Here comes a great celebrity&mdash;Lady Beatrice Bellevue. She&rsquo;s
      awfully fast; see what little steps she takes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate pursued, &ldquo;I hope you are getting some ideas
      for your couturiere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am getting plenty of ideas,&rdquo; said Bessie, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know that my
      couturiere would appreciate them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willie Woodley presently perceived a friend on horseback, who drove up
      beside the barrier of the Row and beckoned to him. He went forward, and
      the crowd of pedestrians closed about him, so that for some ten minutes he
      was hidden from sight. At last he reappeared, bringing a gentleman with
      him&mdash;a gentleman whom Bessie at first supposed to be his friend
      dismounted. But at a second glance she found herself looking at Lord
      Lambeth, who was shaking hands with her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found him over there,&rdquo; said Willie Woodley, &ldquo;and I told him you were
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then Lord Lambeth, touching his hat a little, shook hands with Bessie.
      &ldquo;Fancy your being here!&rdquo; he said. He was blushing and smiling; he looked
      very handsome, and he had a kind of splendor that he had not had in
      America. Bessie Alden&rsquo;s imagination, as we know, was just then in
      exercise; so that the tall young Englishman, as he stood there looking
      down at her, had the benefit of it. &ldquo;He is handsomer and more splendid
      than anything I have ever seen,&rdquo; she said to herself. And then she
      remembered that he was a marquis, and she thought he looked like a
      marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, you know,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you ought to have let a man know you were
      here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote to you an hour ago,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t all the world know it?&rdquo; asked Bessie, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you I didn&rsquo;t know it!&rdquo; cried Lord Lambeth. &ldquo;Upon my honor I
      hadn&rsquo;t heard of it. Ask Woodley now; had I, Woodley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think you are rather a humbug,&rdquo; said Willie Woodley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe that&mdash;do you, Miss Alden?&rdquo; asked his lordship.
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m a humbug, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bessie, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too tall to stand up, Lord Lambeth,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate observed. &ldquo;You
      are only tolerable when you sit down. Be so good as to get a chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found a chair and placed it sidewise, close to the two ladies. &ldquo;If I
      hadn&rsquo;t met Woodley I should never have found you,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Should I,
      Woodley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess not,&rdquo; said the young American.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even with my letter?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Westgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, I haven&rsquo;t got your letter yet; I suppose I shall get it this
      evening. It was awfully kind of you to write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I said to Bessie,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Westgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she say so, Miss Alden?&rdquo; Lord Lambeth inquired. &ldquo;I daresay you have
      been here a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been here three,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been here three months?&rdquo; the young man asked again of Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems a long time,&rdquo; Bessie answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, after that you had better not call me a humbug!&rdquo; cried Lord
      Lambeth. &ldquo;I have only been in town three weeks; but you must have been
      hiding away; I haven&rsquo;t seen you anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where should you have seen us&mdash;where should we have gone?&rdquo; asked
      Mrs. Westgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have gone to Hurlingham,&rdquo; said Willie Woodley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; let Lord Lambeth tell us,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are plenty of places to go to,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth; &ldquo;each one
      stupider than the other. I mean people&rsquo;s houses; they send you cards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one has sent us cards,&rdquo; said Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are very quiet,&rdquo; her sister declared. &ldquo;We are here as travelers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been to Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Bessie pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; cried Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We thought we should find your image there,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate&mdash;&ldquo;yours
      and Mr. Beaumont&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the Chamber of Horrors?&rdquo; laughed the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It did duty very well for a party,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate. &ldquo;All the women
      were decolletes, and many of the figures looked as if they could speak if
      they tried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; Lord Lambeth rejoined, &ldquo;you see people at London parties
      that look as if they couldn&rsquo;t speak if they tried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think Mr. Woodley could find us Mr. Beaumont?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
      Westgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lambeth stared and looked round him. &ldquo;I daresay he could. Beaumont
      often comes here. Don&rsquo;t you think you could find him, Woodley? Make a dive
      into the crowd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; I have had enough diving,&rdquo; said Willie Woodley. &ldquo;I will wait
      till Mr. Beaumont comes to the surface.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will bring him to see you,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth; &ldquo;where are you staying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find the address in my letter&mdash;Jones&rsquo;s Hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, one of those places just out of Piccadilly? Beastly hole, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
       Lord Lambeth inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s the best hotel in London,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they give you awful rubbish to eat, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; his lordship went
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always feel so sorry for the people that come up to town and go to live
      in those places,&rdquo; continued the young man. &ldquo;They eat nothing but filth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; cried Willie Woodley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how do you like London, Miss Alden?&rdquo; Lord Lambeth asked,
      unperturbed by this ejaculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s grand,&rdquo; said Bessie Alden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister likes it, in spite of the &lsquo;filth&rsquo;!&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are going to stay a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As long as I can,&rdquo; said Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is Mr. Westgate?&rdquo; asked Lord Lambeth of this gentleman&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s where he always is&mdash;in that tiresome New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be tremendously clever,&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lambeth sat for nearly an hour with his American friends; but it is
      not our purpose to relate their conversation in full. He addressed a great
      many remarks to Bessie Alden, and finally turned toward her altogether,
      while Willie Woodley entertained Mrs. Westgate. Bessie herself said very
      little; she was on her guard, thinking of what her sister had said to her
      at lunch. Little by little, however, she interested herself in Lord
      Lambeth again, as she had done at Newport; only it seemed to her that here
      he might become more interesting. He would be an unconscious part of the
      antiquity, the impressiveness, the picturesqueness, of England; and poor
      Bessie Alden, like many a Yankee maiden, was terribly at the mercy of
      picturesqueness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have often wished I were at Newport again,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;Those
      days I spent at your sister&rsquo;s were awfully jolly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We enjoyed them very much; I hope your father is better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, yes. When I got to England, he was out grouse shooting. It was
      what you call in America a gigantic fraud. My mother had got nervous. My
      three weeks at Newport seemed like a happy dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;America certainly is very different from England,&rdquo; said Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you like England better, eh?&rdquo; Lord Lambeth rejoined almost
      persuasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No Englishman can ask that seriously of a person of another country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her companion looked at her for a moment. &ldquo;You mean it&rsquo;s a matter of
      course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were English,&rdquo; said Bessie, &ldquo;it would certainly seem to me a matter
      of course that everyone should be a good patriot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, yes, patriotism is everything,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth, not quite
      following, but very contented. &ldquo;Now, what are you going to do here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Thursday I am going to the Tower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Tower?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Tower of London. Did you never hear of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I have been there,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth. &ldquo;I was taken there by my
      governess when I was six years old. It&rsquo;s a rum idea, your going there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do give me a few more rum ideas,&rdquo; said Bessie. &ldquo;I want to see everything
      of that sort. I am going to Hampton Court, and to Windsor, and to the
      Dulwich Gallery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lambeth seemed greatly amused. &ldquo;I wonder you don&rsquo;t go to the
      Rosherville Gardens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they interesting?&rdquo; asked Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they very old? That&rsquo;s all I care for,&rdquo; said Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are tremendously old; they are all falling to ruins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there is nothing so charming as an old ruinous garden,&rdquo; said the
      young girl. &ldquo;We must certainly go there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lambeth broke out into merriment. &ldquo;I say, Woodley,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s
      Miss Alden wants to go to the Rosherville Gardens!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willie Woodley looked a little blank; he was caught in the fact of
      ignorance of an apparently conspicuous feature of London life. But in a
      moment he turned it off. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write for a permit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lambeth&rsquo;s exhilaration increased. &ldquo;Gad, I believe you Americans would
      go anywhere!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We wish to go to Parliament,&rdquo; said Bessie. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the first
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it would bore you to death!&rdquo; cried the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We wish to hear you speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never speak&mdash;except to young ladies,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie Alden looked at him a while, smiling, too, in the shadow of her
      parasol. &ldquo;You are very strange,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I approve of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, now, don&rsquo;t be severe, Miss Alden,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth, smiling still
      more. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t be severe. I want you to like me&mdash;awfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To like you awfully? You must not laugh at me, then, when I make
      mistakes. I consider it my right&mdash;as a freeborn American&mdash;to
      make as many mistakes as I choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, I didn&rsquo;t laugh at you,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not only that,&rdquo; Bessie went on; &ldquo;but I hold that all my mistakes
      shall be set down to my credit. You must think the better of me for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think better of you than I do,&rdquo; the young man declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie Alden looked at him a moment again. &ldquo;You certainly speak very well
      to young ladies. But why don&rsquo;t you address the House?&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that
      what they call it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have nothing to say,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you a great position?&rdquo; asked Bessie Alden.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked a moment at the back of his glove. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll set that down,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;as one of your mistakes&mdash;to your credit.&rdquo; And as if he
      disliked talking about his position, he changed the subject. &ldquo;I wish you
      would let me go with you to the Tower, and to Hampton Court, and to all
      those other places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be most happy,&rdquo; said Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of course I shall be delighted to show you the House of Lords&mdash;some
      day that suits you. There are a lot of things I want to do for you. I want
      to make you have a good time. And I should like very much to present some
      of my friends to you, if it wouldn&rsquo;t bore you. Then it would be awfully
      kind of you to come down to Branches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are much obliged to you, Lord Lambeth,&rdquo; said Bessie. &ldquo;What is
      Branches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a house in the country. I think you might like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willie Woodley and Mrs. Westgate at this moment were sitting in silence,
      and the young man&rsquo;s ear caught these last words of Lord Lambeth&rsquo;s. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      inviting Miss Bessie to one of his castles,&rdquo; he murmured to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westgate, foreseeing what she mentally called &ldquo;complications,&rdquo;
       immediately got up; and the two ladies, taking leave of Lord Lambeth,
      returned, under Mr. Woodley&rsquo;s conduct, to Jones&rsquo;s Hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lambeth came to see them on the morrow, bringing Percy Beaumont with
      him&mdash;the latter having instantly declared his intention of neglecting
      none of the usual offices of civility. This declaration, however, when his
      kinsman informed him of the advent of their American friends, had been
      preceded by another remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here they are, then, and you are in for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I in for?&rdquo; demanded Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will let your mother give it a name. With all respect to whom,&rdquo; added
      Percy Beaumont, &ldquo;I must decline on this occasion to do any more police
      duty. Her Grace must look after you herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give her a chance,&rdquo; said her Grace&rsquo;s son, a trifle grimly. &ldquo;I
      shall make her go and see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t do it, my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see if she doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if Percy Beaumont took a somber view of the arrival of the two ladies
      at Jones&rsquo;s Hotel, he was sufficiently a man of the world to offer them a
      smiling countenance. He fell into animated conversation&mdash;conversation,
      at least, that was animated on her side&mdash;with Mrs. Westgate, while
      his companion made himself agreeable to the younger lady. Mrs. Westgate
      began confessing and protesting, declaring and expounding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say London is a great deal brighter and prettier just now than it
      was when I was here last&mdash;in the month of November. There is
      evidently a great deal going on, and you seem to have a good many flowers.
      I have no doubt it is very charming for all you people, and that you amuse
      yourselves immensely. It is very good of you to let Bessie and me come and
      sit and look at you. I suppose you will think I am very satirical, but I
      must confess that that&rsquo;s the feeling I have in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I don&rsquo;t quite understand to what feeling you allude,&rdquo; said
      Percy Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The feeling that it&rsquo;s all very well for you English people. Everything is
      beautifully arranged for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me it is very well for some Americans, sometimes,&rdquo; rejoined
      Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For some of them, yes&mdash;if they like to be patronized. But I must say
      I don&rsquo;t like to be patronized. I may be very eccentric, and undisciplined,
      and outrageous, but I confess I never was fond of patronage. I like to
      associate with people on the same terms as I do in my own country; that&rsquo;s
      a peculiar taste that I have. But here people seem to expect something
      else&mdash;Heaven knows what! I am afraid you will think I am very
      ungrateful, for I certainly have received a great deal of attention. The
      last time I was here, a lady sent me a message that I was at liberty to
      come and see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! I hope you didn&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; observed Percy Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are deliciously naive, I must say that for you!&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate
      exclaimed. &ldquo;It must be a great advantage to you here in London. I suppose
      that if I myself had a little more naivete, I should enjoy it more. I
      should be content to sit on a chair in the park, and see the people pass,
      and be told that this is the Duchess of Suffolk, and that is the Lord
      Chamberlain, and that I must be thankful for the privilege of beholding
      them. I daresay it is very wicked and critical of me to ask for anything
      else. But I was always critical, and I freely confess to the sin of being
      fastidious. I am told there is some remarkably superior second-rate
      society provided here for strangers. <i>Merci</i>! I don&rsquo;t want any
      superior second-rate society. I want the society that I have been
      accustomed to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t call Lambeth and me second rate,&rdquo; Beaumont interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am accustomed to you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate. &ldquo;Do you know that you
      English sometimes make the most wonderful speeches? The first time I came
      to London I went out to dine&mdash;as I told you, I have received a great
      deal of attention. After dinner, in the drawing room, I had some
      conversation with an old lady; I assure you I had. I forget what we talked
      about, but she presently said, in allusion to something we were
      discussing, &lsquo;Oh, you know, the aristocracy do so-and-so; but in one&rsquo;s own
      class of life it is very different.&rsquo; In one&rsquo;s own class of life! What is a
      poor unprotected American woman to do in a country where she is liable to
      have that sort of thing said to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to get hold of some very queer old ladies; I compliment you on
      your acquaintance!&rdquo; Percy Beaumont exclaimed. &ldquo;If you are trying to bring
      me to admit that London is an odious place, you&rsquo;ll not succeed. I&rsquo;m
      extremely fond of it, and I think it the jolliest place in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Pour vous autres</i>. I never said the contrary,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate
      retorted. I make use of this expression, because both interlocutors had
      begun to raise their voices. Percy Beaumont naturally did not like to hear
      his country abused, and Mrs. Westgate, no less naturally, did not like a
      stubborn debater.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth; &ldquo;what are they up to now?&rdquo; And he came away
      from the window, where he had been standing with Bessie Alden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree with a very clever countrywoman of mine,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate
      continued with charming ardor, though with imperfect relevancy. She smiled
      at the two gentlemen for a moment with terrible brightness, as if to toss
      at their feet&mdash;upon their native heath&mdash;the gauntlet of
      defiance. &ldquo;For me, there are only two social positions worth speaking of&mdash;that
      of an American lady and that of the Emperor of Russia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you do with the American gentlemen?&rdquo; asked Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She leaves them in America!&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the departure of their visitors, Bessie Alden told her sister that Lord
      Lambeth would come the next day, to go with them to the Tower, and that he
      had kindly offered to bring his &ldquo;trap&rdquo; and drive them thither. Mrs.
      Westgate listened in silence to this communication, and for some time
      afterward she said nothing. But at last, &ldquo;If you had not requested me the
      other day not to mention it,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;there is something I should
      venture to ask you.&rdquo; Bessie frowned a little; her dark blue eyes were more
      dark than blue. But her sister went on. &ldquo;As it is, I will take the risk.
      You are not in love with Lord Lambeth: I believe it, perfectly. Very good.
      But is there, by chance, any danger of your becoming so? It&rsquo;s a very
      simple question; don&rsquo;t take offense. I have a particular reason,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Westgate, &ldquo;for wanting to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bessie Alden for some moments said nothing; she only looked displeased.
      &ldquo;No; there is no danger,&rdquo; she answered at last, curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I should like to frighten them,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Westgate, clasping
      her jeweled hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To frighten whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All these people; Lord Lambeth&rsquo;s family and friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should you frighten them?&rdquo; asked the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be I&mdash;it would be you. It would frighten them to think
      that you should absorb his lordship&rsquo;s young affections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bessie Alden, with her clear eyes still overshadowed by her dark brows,
      continued to interrogate. &ldquo;Why should that frighten them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westgate poised her answer with a smile before delivering it.
      &ldquo;Because they think you are not good enough. You are a charming girl,
      beautiful and amiable, intelligent and clever, and as bien-elevee as it is
      possible to be; but you are not a fit match for Lord Lambeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bessie Alden was decidedly disgusted. &ldquo;Where do you get such extraordinary
      ideas?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You have said some such strange things lately. My dear
      Kitty, where do you collect them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was evidently enamored of her idea. &ldquo;Yes, it would put them on pins
      and needles, and it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt you. Mr. Beaumont is already most
      uneasy; I could soon see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl meditated a moment. &ldquo;Do you mean that they spy upon him&mdash;that
      they interfere with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what power they have to interfere, but I know that a British
      mama may worry her son&rsquo;s life out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It has been intimated that, as regards certain disagreeable things, Bessie
      Alden had a fund of skepticism. She abstained on the present occasion from
      expressing disbelief, for she wished not to irritate her sister. But she
      said to herself that Kitty had been misinformed&mdash;that this was a
      traveler&rsquo;s tale. Though she was a girl of a lively imagination, there
      could in the nature of things be, to her sense, no reality in the idea of
      her belonging to a vulgar category. What she said aloud was, &ldquo;I must say
      that in that case I am very sorry for Lord Lambeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westgate, more and more exhilarated by her scheme, was smiling at her
      again. &ldquo;If I could only believe it was safe!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;When you
      begin to pity him, I, on my side, am afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid of what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of your pitying him too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bessie Alden turned away impatiently; but at the end of a minute she
      turned back. &ldquo;What if I should pity him too much?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westgate hereupon turned away, but after a moment&rsquo;s reflection she
      also faced her sister again. &ldquo;It would come, after all, to the same
      thing,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lambeth came the next day with his trap, and the two ladies, attended
      by Willie Woodley, placed themselves under his guidance, and were conveyed
      eastward, through some of the duskier portions of the metropolis, to the
      great turreted donjon which overlooks the London shipping. They all
      descended from their vehicle and entered the famous inclosure; and they
      secured the services of a venerable beefeater, who, though there were many
      other claimants for legendary information, made a fine exclusive party of
      them and marched them through courts and corridors, through armories and
      prisons. He delivered his usual peripatetic discourse, and they stopped
      and stared, and peeped and stooped, according to the official admonitions.
      Bessie Alden asked the old man in the crimson doublet a great many
      questions; she thought it a most fascinating place. Lord Lambeth was in
      high good humor; he was constantly laughing; he enjoyed what he would have
      called the lark. Willie Woodley kept looking at the ceilings and tapping
      the walls with the knuckle of a pearl-gray glove; and Mrs. Westgate,
      asking at frequent intervals to be allowed to sit down and wait till they
      came back, was as frequently informed that they would never come back. To
      a great many of Bessie&rsquo;s questions&mdash;chiefly on collateral points of
      English history&mdash;the ancient warder was naturally unable to reply;
      whereupon she always appealed to Lord Lambeth. But his lordship was very
      ignorant. He declared that he knew nothing about that sort of thing, and
      he seemed greatly diverted at being treated as an authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect everyone to know as much as you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should expect you to know a great deal more,&rdquo; declared Bessie Alden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women always know more than men about names and dates and that sort of
      thing,&rdquo; Lord Lambeth rejoined. &ldquo;There was Lady Jane Grey we have just been
      hearing about, who went in for Latin and Greek and all the learning of her
      age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>you</i> have no right to be ignorant, at all events,&rdquo; said Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t I as good a right as anyone else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you have lived in the midst of all these things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What things do you mean? Axes, and blocks, and thumbscrews?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All these historical things. You belong to a historical family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bessie is really too historical,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate, catching a word of
      this dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are too historical,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth, laughing, but thankful
      for a formula. &ldquo;Upon my honor, you are too historical!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went with the ladies a couple of days later to Hampton Court, Willie
      Woodley being also of the party. The afternoon was charming, the famous
      horse chestnuts were in blossom, and Lord Lambeth, who quite entered into
      the spirit of the cockney excursionist, declared that it was a jolly old
      place. Bessie Alden was in ecstasies; she went about murmuring and
      exclaiming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too lovely,&rdquo; said the young girl; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too enchanting; it&rsquo;s too
      exactly what it ought to be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At Hampton Court the little flocks of visitors are not provided with an
      official bellwether, but are left to browse at discretion upon the local
      antiquities. It happened in this manner that, in default of another
      informant, Bessie Alden, who on doubtful questions was able to suggest a
      great many alternatives, found herself again applying for intellectual
      assistance to Lord Lambeth. But he again assured her that he was utterly
      helpless in such matters&mdash;that his education had been sadly
      neglected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am sorry it makes you unhappy,&rdquo; he added in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very disappointing, Lord Lambeth,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, now don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst thing you could
      possibly say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she rejoined, &ldquo;it is not so bad as to say that I had expected
      nothing of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Give me a notion of the sort of thing you expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bessie Alden, &ldquo;that you would be more what I should like to
      be&mdash;what I should try to be&mdash;in your place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my place!&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Lambeth. &ldquo;You are always talking about my
      place!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl looked at him; he thought she colored a little; and for a
      moment she made no rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it strike you that I am always talking about your place?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you do it a great honor,&rdquo; he said, fearing he had been uncivil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have often thought about it,&rdquo; she went on after a moment. &ldquo;I have often
      thought about your being a hereditary legislator. A hereditary legislator
      ought to know a great many things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if he doesn&rsquo;t legislate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you do legislate; it&rsquo;s absurd your saying you don&rsquo;t. You are very
      much looked up to here&mdash;I am assured of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I ever noticed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is because you are used to it, then. You ought to fill the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean to fill it?&rdquo; asked Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to be very clever and brilliant, and to know almost
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lambeth looked at her a moment. &ldquo;Shall I tell you something?&rdquo; he
      asked. &ldquo;A young man in my position, as you call it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t invent the term,&rdquo; interposed Bessie Alden. &ldquo;I have seen it in a
      great many books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it! you are always at your books. A fellow in my position, then,
      does very well whatever he does. That&rsquo;s about what I mean to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if your own people are content with you,&rdquo; said Bessie Alden,
      laughing, &ldquo;it is not for me to complain. But I shall always think that,
      properly, you should have been a great mind&mdash;a great character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s very theoretic,&rdquo; Lord Lambeth declared. &ldquo;Depend upon it,
      that&rsquo;s a Yankee prejudice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy the country,&rdquo; said Bessie Alden, &ldquo;where even people&rsquo;s prejudices
      are so elevated!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, after all,&rdquo; observed Lord Lambeth, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I am such a
      fool as you are trying to make me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said nothing so rude as that; but I must repeat that you are
      disappointing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Alden,&rdquo; exclaimed the young man, &ldquo;I am the best fellow in
      the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, if it were not for that!&rdquo; said Bessie Alden with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westgate had a good many more friends in London than she pretended,
      and before long she had renewed acquaintance with most of them. Their
      hospitality was extreme, so that, one thing leading to another, she began,
      as the phrase is, to go out. Bessie Alden, in this way, saw something of
      what she found it a great satisfaction to call to herself English society.
      She went to balls and danced, she went to dinners and talked, she went to
      concerts and listened (at concerts Bessie always listened), she went to
      exhibitions and wondered. Her enjoyment was keen and her curiosity
      insatiable, and, grateful in general for all her opportunities, she
      especially prized the privilege of meeting certain celebrated persons&mdash;authors
      and artists, philosophers and statesmen&mdash;of whose renown she had been
      a humble and distant beholder, and who now, as a part of the habitual
      furniture of London drawing rooms, struck her as stars fallen from the
      firmament and become palpable&mdash;revealing also sometimes, on contact,
      qualities not to have been predicted of sidereal bodies. Bessie, who knew
      so many of her contemporaries by reputation, had a good many personal
      disappointments; but, on the other hand, she had innumerable satisfactions
      and enthusiasms, and she communicated the emotions of either class to a
      dear friend, of her own sex, in Boston, with whom she was in voluminous
      correspondence. Some of her reflections, indeed, she attempted to impart
      to Lord Lambeth, who came almost every day to Jones&rsquo;s Hotel, and whom Mrs.
      Westgate admitted to be really devoted. Captain Littledale, it appeared,
      had gone to India; and of several others of Mrs. Westgate&rsquo;s ex-pensioners&mdash;gentlemen
      who, as she said, had made, in New York, a clubhouse of her drawing room&mdash;no
      tidings were to be obtained; but Lord Lambeth was certainly attentive
      enough to make up for the accidental absences, the short memories, all the
      other irregularities of everyone else. He drove them in the park, he took
      them to visit private collections of pictures, and, having a house of his
      own, invited them to dinner. Mrs. Westgate, following the fashion of many
      of her compatriots, caused herself and her sister to be presented at the
      English court by her diplomatic representative&mdash;for it was in this
      manner that she alluded to the American minister to England, inquiring
      what on earth he was put there for, if not to make the proper arrangements
      for one&rsquo;s going to a Drawing Room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lambeth declared that he hated Drawing Rooms, but he participated in
      the ceremony on the day on which the two ladies at Jones&rsquo;s Hotel repaired
      to Buckingham Palace in a remarkable coach which his lordship had sent to
      fetch them. He had on a gorgeous uniform, and Bessie Alden was
      particularly struck with his appearance&mdash;especially when on her
      asking him, rather foolishly as she felt, if he were a loyal subject, he
      replied that he was a loyal subject to <i>her</i>. This declaration was
      emphasized by his dancing with her at a royal ball to which the two ladies
      afterward went, and was not impaired by the fact that she thought he
      danced very ill. He seemed to her wonderfully kind; she asked herself,
      with growing vivacity, why he should be so kind. It was his disposition&mdash;that
      seemed the natural answer. She had told her sister that she liked him very
      much, and now that she liked him more she wondered why. She liked him for
      his disposition; to this question as well that seemed the natural answer.
      When once the impressions of London life began to crowd thickly upon her,
      she completely forgot her sister&rsquo;s warning about the cynicism of public
      opinion. It had given her great pain at the moment, but there was no
      particular reason why she should remember it; it corresponded too little
      with any sensible reality; and it was disagreeable to Bessie to remember
      disagreeable things. So she was not haunted with the sense of a vulgar
      imputation. She was not in love with Lord Lambeth&mdash;she assured
      herself of that. It will immediately be observed that when such assurances
      become necessary the state of a young lady&rsquo;s affections is already
      ambiguous; and, indeed, Bessie Alden made no attempt to dissimulate&mdash;to
      herself, of course&mdash;a certain tenderness that she felt for the young
      nobleman. She said to herself that she liked the type to which he belonged&mdash;the
      simple, candid, manly, healthy English temperament. She spoke to herself
      of him as women speak of young men they like&mdash;alluded to his bravery
      (which she had never in the least seen tested), to his honesty and
      gentlemanliness, and was not silent upon the subject of his good looks.
      She was perfectly conscious, moreover, that she liked to think of his more
      adventitious merits; that her imagination was excited and gratified by the
      sight of a handsome young man endowed with such large opportunities&mdash;opportunities
      she hardly knew for what, but, as she supposed, for doing great things&mdash;for
      setting an example, for exerting an influence, for conferring happiness,
      for encouraging the arts. She had a kind of ideal of conduct for a young
      man who should find himself in this magnificent position, and she tried to
      adapt it to Lord Lambeth&rsquo;s deportment as you might attempt to fit a
      silhouette in cut paper upon a shadow projected upon a wall. But Bessie
      Alden&rsquo;s silhouette refused to coincide with his lordship&rsquo;s image, and this
      want of harmony sometimes vexed her more than she thought reasonable. When
      he was absent it was, of course, less striking; then he seemed to her a
      sufficiently graceful combination of high responsibilities and amiable
      qualities. But when he sat there within sight, laughing and talking with
      his customary good humor and simplicity, she measured it more accurately,
      and she felt acutely that if Lord Lambeth&rsquo;s position was heroic, there was
      but little of the hero in the young man himself. Then her imagination
      wandered away from him&mdash;very far away; for it was an incontestable
      fact that at such moments he seemed distinctly dull. I am afraid that
      while Bessie&rsquo;s imagination was thus invidiously roaming, she cannot have
      been herself a very lively companion; but it may well have been that these
      occasional fits of indifference seemed to Lord Lambeth a part of the young
      girl&rsquo;s personal charm. It had been a part of this charm from the first
      that he felt that she judged him and measured him more freely and
      irresponsibly&mdash;more at her ease and her leisure, as it were&mdash;than
      several young ladies with whom he had been on the whole about as intimate.
      To feel this, and yet to feel that she also liked him, was very agreeable
      to Lord Lambeth. He fancied he had compassed that gratification so
      desirable to young men of title and fortune&mdash;being liked for himself.
      It is true that a cynical counselor might have whispered to him, &ldquo;Liked
      for yourself? Yes; but not so very much!&rdquo; He had, at any rate, the
      constant hope of being liked more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may seem, perhaps, a trifle singular&mdash;but it is nevertheless true&mdash;that
      Bessie Alden, when he struck her as dull, devoted some time, on grounds of
      conscience, to trying to like him more. I say on grounds of conscience
      because she felt that he had been extremely &ldquo;nice&rdquo; to her sister, and
      because she reflected that it was no more than fair that she should think
      as well of him as he thought of her. This effort was possibly sometimes
      not so successful as it might have been, for the result of it was
      occasionally a vague irritation, which expressed itself in hostile
      criticism of several British institutions. Bessie Alden went to some
      entertainments at which she met Lord Lambeth; but she went to others at
      which his lordship was neither actually nor potentially present; and it
      was chiefly on these latter occasions that she encountered those literary
      and artistic celebrities of whom mention has been made. After a while she
      reduced the matter to a principle. If Lord Lambeth should appear anywhere,
      it was a symbol that there would be no poets and philosophers; and in
      consequence&mdash;for it was almost a strict consequence&mdash;she used to
      enumerate to the young man these objects of her admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be awfully fond of those sort of people,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth
      one day, as if the idea had just occurred to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are the people in England I am most curious to see,&rdquo; Bessie Alden
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s because you have read so much,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth
      gallantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not read so much. It is because we think so much of them at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; observed the young nobleman. &ldquo;In Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not only in Boston; everywhere,&rdquo; said Bessie. &ldquo;We hold them in great
      honor; they go to the best dinner parties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay you are right. I can&rsquo;t say I know many of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Bessie Alden declared. &ldquo;It would do you good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay it would,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth very humbly. &ldquo;But I must say I
      don&rsquo;t like the looks of some of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither do I&mdash;of some of them. But there are all kinds, and many of
      them are charming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have talked with two or three of them,&rdquo; the young man went on, &ldquo;and I
      thought they had a kind of fawning manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should they fawn?&rdquo; Bessie Alden demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. Why, indeed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you only thought so,&rdquo; said Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course,&rdquo; rejoined her companion, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a kind of thing that
      can&rsquo;t be proved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In America they don&rsquo;t fawn,&rdquo; said Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, then, they must be better company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bessie was silent a moment. &ldquo;That is one of the things I don&rsquo;t like about
      England,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;your keeping the distinguished people apart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean apart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, letting them come only to certain places. You never see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lambeth looked at her a moment. &ldquo;What people do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The eminent people&mdash;the authors and artists&mdash;the clever
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there are other eminent people besides those,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you certainly keep them apart,&rdquo; repeated the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there are other clever people,&rdquo; added Lord Lambeth simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie Alden looked at him, and she gave a light laugh. &ldquo;Not many,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      On another occasion&mdash;just after a dinner party&mdash;she told him
      that there was something else in England she did not like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you abused us enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never abused you at all,&rdquo; said Bessie; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t like your <i>precedence</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t my precedence!&rdquo; Lord Lambeth declared, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is yours&mdash;just exactly yours; and I think it&rsquo;s odious,&rdquo; said
      Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw such a young lady for discussing things! Has someone had the
      impudence to go before you?&rdquo; asked his lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the going before me that I object to,&rdquo; said Bessie; &ldquo;it is
      their thinking that they have a right to do it&mdash;<i>a right that I
      recognize</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw such a young lady as you are for not &lsquo;recognizing.&rsquo; I have no
      doubt the thing is <i>beastly</i>, but it saves a lot of trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes a lot of trouble. It&rsquo;s horrid,&rdquo; said Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how would you have the first people go?&rdquo; asked Lord Lambeth. &ldquo;They
      can&rsquo;t go last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom do you mean by the first people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, if you mean to question first principles!&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If those are your first principles, no wonder some of your arrangements
      are horrid,&rdquo; observed Bessie Alden with a very pretty ferocity. &ldquo;I am a
      young girl, so of course I go last; but imagine what Kitty must feel on
      being informed that she is not at liberty to budge until certain other
      ladies have passed out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say, she is not &lsquo;informed!&rsquo;&rdquo; cried Lord Lambeth. &ldquo;No one would do
      such a thing as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is made to feel it,&rdquo; the young girl insisted&mdash;&ldquo;as if they were
      afraid she would make a rush for the door. No; you have a lovely country,&rdquo;
       said Bessie Alden, &ldquo;but your precedence is horrid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly shouldn&rsquo;t think your sister would like it,&rdquo; rejoined Lord
      Lambeth with even exaggerated gravity. But Bessie Alden could induce him
      to enter no formal protest against this repulsive custom, which he seemed
      to think an extreme convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percy Beaumont all this time had been a very much less frequent visitor at
      Jones&rsquo;s Hotel than his noble kinsman; he had, in fact, called but twice
      upon the two American ladies. Lord Lambeth, who often saw him, reproached
      him with his neglect and declared that, although Mrs. Westgate had said
      nothing about it, he was sure that she was secretly wounded by it. &ldquo;She
      suffers too much to speak,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all gammon,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a limit to what people
      can suffer!&rdquo; And, though sending no apologies to Jones&rsquo;s Hotel, he
      undertook in a manner to explain his absence. &ldquo;You are always there,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s reason enough for my not going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why. There is enough for both of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to be a witness of your&mdash;your reckless passion,&rdquo; said
      Percy Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lambeth looked at him with a cold eye and for a moment said nothing.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so obvious as you might suppose,&rdquo; he rejoined dryly,
      &ldquo;considering what a demonstrative beggar I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know anything about it&mdash;nothing whatever,&rdquo; said
      Beaumont. &ldquo;Your mother asks me everytime she sees me whether I believe you
      are really lost&mdash;and Lady Pimlico does the same. I prefer to be able
      to answer that I know nothing about it&mdash;that I never go there. I stay
      away for consistency&rsquo;s sake. As I said the other day, they must look after
      you themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are devilish considerate,&rdquo; said Lord Lambeth. &ldquo;They never question
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are afraid of you. They are afraid of irritating you and making you
      worse. So they go to work very cautiously, and, somewhere or other, they
      get their information. They know a great deal about you. They know that
      you have been with those ladies to the dome of St. Paul&rsquo;s and&mdash;where
      was the other place?&mdash;to the Thames Tunnel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If all their knowledge is as accurate as that, it must be very valuable,&rdquo;
       said Lord Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, at any rate, they know that you have been visiting the &lsquo;sights of
      the metropolis.&rsquo; They think&mdash;very naturally, as it seems to me&mdash;that
      when you take to visiting the sights of the metropolis with a little
      American girl, there is serious cause for alarm.&rdquo; Lord Lambeth responded
      to this intimation by scornful laughter, and his companion continued,
      after a pause: &ldquo;I said just now I didn&rsquo;t want to know anything about the
      affair; but I will confess that I am curious to learn whether you propose
      to marry Miss Bessie Alden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On this point Lord Lambeth gave his interlocutor no immediate
      satisfaction; he was musing, with a frown. &ldquo;By Jove,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they go
      rather too far. They <i>shall</i> find me dangerous&mdash;I promise them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Percy Beaumont began to laugh. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t redeem your promises. You said
      the other day you would make your mother call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lambeth continued to meditate. &ldquo;I asked her to call,&rdquo; he said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she declined?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but she shall do it yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont, &ldquo;if she gets much more frightened I
      believe she will.&rdquo; Lord Lambeth looked at him, and he went on. &ldquo;She will
      go to the girl herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean she will go to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will beg her off, or she will bribe her. She will take strong
      measures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lambeth turned away in silence, and his companion watched him take
      twenty steps and then slowly return. &ldquo;I have invited Mrs. Westgate and
      Miss Alden to Branches,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and this evening I shall name a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And shall you invite your mother and your sisters to meet them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explicitly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will set the duchess off,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont. &ldquo;I suspect she will
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may do as she pleases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beaumont looked at Lord Lambeth. &ldquo;You do really propose to marry the
      little sister, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like the way you talk about it!&rdquo; cried the young man. &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t gobble
      me down; don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t leave you on your knees,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont. &ldquo;What IS the
      inducement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk about proposing: wait till I <i>have</i> proposed,&rdquo; Lord Lambeth
      went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, my dear fellow; think about it,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a charming girl,&rdquo; pursued his lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she&rsquo;s a charming girl. I don&rsquo;t know a girl more charming,
      intrinsically. But there are other charming girls nearer home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like her spirit,&rdquo; observed Lord Lambeth, almost as if he were trying to
      torment his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the peculiarity of her spirit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not afraid, and she says things out, and she thinks herself as good
      as anyone. She is the only girl I have ever seen that was not dying to
      marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that, if you haven&rsquo;t asked her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how; but I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure she asked me questions enough about your property and your
      titles,&rdquo; said Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has asked me questions, too; no end of them,&rdquo; Lord Lambeth admitted.
      &ldquo;But she asked for information, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Information? Aye, I&rsquo;ll warrant she wanted it. Depend upon it that she is
      dying to marry you just as much and just as little as all the rest of
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like her to refuse me&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the thing would be so disagreeable, then, both to you and to her, in
      Heaven&rsquo;s name leave it alone,&rdquo; said Percy Beaumont.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westgate, on her side, had plenty to say to her sister about the
      rarity of Mr. Beaumont&rsquo;s visits and the nonappearance of the Duchess of
      Bayswater. She professed, however, to derive more satisfaction from this
      latter circumstance than she could have done from the most lavish
      attentions on the part of this great lady. &ldquo;It is most marked,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;most
      marked. It is a delicious proof that we have made them miserable. The day
      we dined with Lord Lambeth I was really sorry for the poor fellow.&rdquo; It
      will have been gathered that the entertainment offered by Lord Lambeth to
      his American friends had not been graced by the presence of his anxious
      mother. He had invited several choice spirits to meet them; but the ladies
      of his immediate family were to Mrs. Westgate&rsquo;s sense&mdash;a sense
      possibly morbidly acute&mdash;conspicuous by their absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to express myself in a manner that you dislike,&rdquo; said Bessie
      Alden; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know why you should have so many theories about Lord
      Lambeth&rsquo;s poor mother. You know a great many young men in New York without
      knowing their mothers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westgate looked at her sister and then turned away. &ldquo;My dear Bessie,
      you are superb!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing is certain,&rdquo; the young girl continued. &ldquo;If I believed I were a
      cause of annoyance&mdash;however unwitting&mdash;to Lord Lambeth&rsquo;s family,
      I should insist&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insist upon my leaving England,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not that. I want to go to the National Gallery again; I want to see
      Stratford-on-Avon and Canterbury Cathedral. But I should insist upon his
      coming to see us no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be very modest and very pretty of you; but you wouldn&rsquo;t do it
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say &lsquo;now&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Bessie Alden. &ldquo;Have I ceased to be modest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You care for him too much. A month ago, when you said you didn&rsquo;t, I
      believe it was quite true. But at present, my dear child,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Westgate, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t find it quite so simple a matter never to see Lord
      Lambeth again. I have seen it coming on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; said Bessie. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, don&rsquo;t be perverse,&rdquo; rejoined her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know him better, certainly, if you mean that,&rdquo; said Bessie. &ldquo;And I like
      him very much. But I don&rsquo;t like him enough to make trouble for him with
      his family. However, I don&rsquo;t believe in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like the way you say &lsquo;however,&rsquo;&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate exclaimed. &ldquo;Come; you
      would not marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westgate for a moment seemed vexed. &ldquo;Why not, pray?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t care to,&rdquo; said Bessie Alden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning after Lord Lambeth had had, with Percy Beaumont, that exchange
      of ideas which has just been narrated, the ladies at Jones&rsquo;s Hotel
      received from his lordship a written invitation to pay their projected
      visit to Branches Castle on the following Tuesday. &ldquo;I think I have made up
      a very pleasant party,&rdquo; the young nobleman said. &ldquo;Several people whom you
      know, and my mother and sisters, who have so long been regrettably
      prevented from making your acquaintance.&rdquo; Bessie Alden lost no time in
      calling her sister&rsquo;s attention to the injustice she had done the Duchess
      of Bayswater, whose hostility was now proved to be a vain illusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till you see if she comes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate. &ldquo;And if she is to
      meet us at her son&rsquo;s house the obligation was all the greater for her to
      call upon us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bessie had not to wait long, and it appeared that Lord Lambeth&rsquo;s mother
      now accepted Mrs. Westgate&rsquo;s view of her duties. On the morrow, early in
      the afternoon, two cards were brought to the apartment of the American
      ladies&mdash;one of them bearing the name of the Duchess of Bayswater and
      the other that of the Countess of Pimlico. Mrs. Westgate glanced at the
      clock. &ldquo;It is not yet four,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;they have come early; they wish to
      see us. We will receive them.&rdquo; And she gave orders that her visitors
      should be admitted. A few moments later they were introduced, and there
      was a solemn exchange of amenities. The duchess was a large lady, with a
      fine fresh color; the Countess of Pimlico was very pretty and elegant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duchess looked about her as she sat down&mdash;looked not especially
      at Mrs. Westgate. &ldquo;I daresay my son has told you that I have been wanting
      to come and see you,&rdquo; she observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate, vaguely&mdash;her conscience not
      allowing her to assent to this proposition&mdash;and, indeed, not
      permitting her to enunciate her own with any appreciable emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says you were so kind to him in America,&rdquo; said the duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are very glad,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate replied, &ldquo;to have been able to make him
      a little more&mdash;a little less&mdash;a little more comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he stayed at your house,&rdquo; remarked the Duchess of Bayswater,
      looking at Bessie Alden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very short time,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the duchess; and she continued to look at Bessie, who was
      engaged in conversation with her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like London?&rdquo; Lady Pimlico had asked of Bessie, after looking at
      her a good deal&mdash;at her face and her hands, her dress and her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much indeed,&rdquo; said Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like this hotel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very comfortable,&rdquo; said Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like stopping at hotels?&rdquo; inquired Lady Pimlico after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very fond of traveling,&rdquo; Bessie answered, &ldquo;and I suppose hotels are
      a necessary part of it. But they are not the part I am fondest of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hate traveling,&rdquo; said the Countess of Pimlico and transferred her
      attention to Mrs. Westgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son tells me you are going to Branches,&rdquo; the duchess presently
      resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Lambeth has been so good as to ask us,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate, who
      perceived that her visitor had now begun to look at her, and who had her
      customary happy consciousness of a distinguished appearance. The only
      mitigation of her felicity on this point was that, having inspected her
      visitor&rsquo;s own costume, she said to herself, &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t know how well I am
      dressed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has asked me to go, but I am not sure I shall be able,&rdquo; murmured the
      duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had offered us the p&mdash;prospect of meeting you,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Westgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate the country at this season,&rdquo; responded the duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westgate gave a little shrug. &ldquo;I think it is pleasanter than London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the duchess&rsquo;s eyes were absent again; she was looking very fixedly at
      Bessie. In a moment she slowly rose, walked to a chair that stood empty at
      the young girl&rsquo;s right hand, and silently seated herself. As she was a
      majestic, voluminous woman, this little transaction had, inevitably, an
      air of somewhat impressive intention. It diffused a certain awkwardness,
      which Lady Pimlico, as a sympathetic daughter, perhaps desired to rectify
      in turning to Mrs. Westgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay you go out a great deal,&rdquo; she observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, very little. We are strangers, and we didn&rsquo;t come here for society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Lady Pimlico. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather nice in town just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s charming,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate. &ldquo;But we only go to see a few people&mdash;whom
      we like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course one can&rsquo;t like everyone,&rdquo; said Lady Pimlico.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends upon one&rsquo;s society,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess meanwhile had addressed herself to Bessie. &ldquo;My son tells me
      the young ladies in America are so clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad they made so good an impression on him,&rdquo; said Bessie, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess was not smiling; her large fresh face was very tranquil. &ldquo;He
      is very susceptible,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He thinks everyone clever, and sometimes
      they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; Bessie assented, smiling still.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duchess looked at her a little and then went on; &ldquo;Lambeth is very
      susceptible, but he is very volatile, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Volatile?&rdquo; asked Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very inconstant. It won&rsquo;t do to depend on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Bessie, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recognize that description. We have depended
      on him greatly&mdash;my sister and I&mdash;and he has never disappointed
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will disappoint you yet,&rdquo; said the duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie gave a little laugh, as if she were amused at the duchess&rsquo;s
      persistency. &ldquo;I suppose it will depend on what we expect of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The less you expect, the better,&rdquo; Lord Lambeth&rsquo;s mother declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bessie, &ldquo;we expect nothing unreasonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The duchess for a moment was silent, though she appeared to have more to
      say. &ldquo;Lambeth says he has seen so much of you,&rdquo; she presently began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been to see us very often; he has been very kind,&rdquo; said Bessie
      Alden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay you are used to that. I am told there is a great deal of that
      in America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great deal of kindness?&rdquo; the young girl inquired, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that what you call it? I know you have different expressions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We certainly don&rsquo;t always understand each other,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate, the
      termination of whose interview with Lady Pimlico allowed her to give her
      attention to their elder visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am speaking of the young men calling so much upon the young ladies,&rdquo;
       the duchess explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely in England,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate, &ldquo;the young ladies don&rsquo;t call
      upon the young men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of them do&mdash;almost!&rdquo; Lady Pimlico declared. &ldquo;What the young men
      are a great <i>parti</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bessie, you must make a note of that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate. &ldquo;My sister,&rdquo;
       she added, &ldquo;is a model traveler. She writes down all the curious facts she
      hears in a little book she keeps for the purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The duchess was a little flushed; she looked all about the room, while her
      daughter turned to Bessie. &ldquo;My brother told us you were wonderfully
      clever,&rdquo; said Lady Pimlico.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He should have said my sister,&rdquo; Bessie answered&mdash;&ldquo;when she says such
      things as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you be long at Branches?&rdquo; the duchess asked, abruptly, of the young
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Lambeth has asked us for three days,&rdquo; said Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go,&rdquo; the duchess declared, &ldquo;and my daughter, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be charming!&rdquo; Bessie rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delightful!&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Westgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall expect to see a great deal of you,&rdquo; the duchess continued. &ldquo;When
      I go to Branches I monopolize my son&rsquo;s guests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must be most happy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate very graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want immensely to see it&mdash;to see the castle,&rdquo; said Bessie to the
      duchess. &ldquo;I have never seen one&mdash;in England, at least; and you know
      we have none in America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you are fond of castles?&rdquo; inquired her Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immensely!&rdquo; replied the young girl. &ldquo;It has been the dream of my life to
      live in one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The duchess looked at her a moment, as if she hardly knew how to take this
      assurance, which, from her Grace&rsquo;s point of view, was either very artless
      or very audacious. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, rising, &ldquo;I will show you Branches
      myself.&rdquo; And upon this the two great ladies took their departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did they mean by it?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Westgate, when they were gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They meant to be polite,&rdquo; said Bessie, &ldquo;because we are going to meet
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too late to be polite,&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate replied almost grimly. &ldquo;They
      meant to overawe us by their fine manners and their grandeur, and to make
      you <i>lacher prise</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Lacher prise</i>? What strange things you say!&rdquo; murmured Bessie Alden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They meant to snub us, so that we shouldn&rsquo;t dare to go to Branches,&rdquo; Mrs.
      Westgate continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said Bessie, &ldquo;the duchess offered to show me the place
      herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you may depend upon it she won&rsquo;t let you out of her sight. She will
      show you the place from morning till night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a theory for everything,&rdquo; said Bessie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you apparently have none for anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw no attempt to &lsquo;overawe&rsquo; us,&rdquo; said the young girl. &ldquo;Their manners
      were not fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were not even good!&rdquo; Mrs. Westgate declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessie was silent a while, but in a few moments she observed that she had
      a very good theory. &ldquo;They came to look at me,&rdquo; she said, as if this had
      been a very ingenious hypothesis. Mrs. Westgate did it justice; she
      greeted it with a smile and pronounced it most brilliant, while, in
      reality, she felt that the young girl&rsquo;s skepticism, or her charity, or, as
      she had sometimes called it appropriately, her idealism, was proof against
      irony. Bessie, however, remained meditative all the rest of that day and
      well on into the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow, before lunch, Mrs. Westgate had occasion to go out for an
      hour, and left her sister writing a letter. When she came back she met
      Lord Lambeth at the door of the hotel, coming away. She thought he looked
      slightly embarrassed; he was certainly very grave. &ldquo;I am sorry to have
      missed you. Won&rsquo;t you come back?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. I have seen your sister. I can never
      come back.&rdquo; Then he looked at her a moment and took her hand. &ldquo;Goodbye,
      Mrs. Westgate,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have been very kind to me.&rdquo; And with what
      she thought a strange, sad look in his handsome young face, he turned
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went in, and she found Bessie still writing her letter; that is, Mrs.
      Westgate perceived she was sitting at the table with the pen in her hand
      and not writing. &ldquo;Lord Lambeth has been here,&rdquo; said the elder lady at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Bessie got up and showed her a pale, serious face. She bent this face
      upon her sister for some time, confessing silently and a little pleading.
      &ldquo;I told him,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;that we could not go to Branches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Westgate displayed just a spark of irritation. &ldquo;He might have
      waited,&rdquo; she said with a smile, &ldquo;till one had seen the castle.&rdquo; Later, an
      hour afterward, she said, &ldquo;Dear Bessie, I wish you might have accepted
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bessie gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is an excellent fellow,&rdquo; said Mrs. Westgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Bessie repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is only,&rdquo; her sister added, &ldquo;because those women will think that
      they succeeded&mdash;that they paralyzed us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bessie Alden turned away; but presently she added, &ldquo;They were interesting;
      I should have liked to see them again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So should I!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Westgate significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I should have liked to see the castle,&rdquo; said Bessie. &ldquo;But now we must
      leave England,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sister looked at her. &ldquo;You will not wait to go to the National
      Gallery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor to Canterbury Cathedral?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bessie reflected a moment. &ldquo;We can stop there on our way to Paris,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lambeth did not tell Percy Beaumont that the contingency he was not
      prepared at all to like had occurred; but Percy Beaumont, on hearing that
      the two ladies had left London, wondered with some intensity what had
      happened; wondered, that is, until the Duchess of Bayswater came a little
      to his assistance. The two ladies went to Paris, and Mrs. Westgate
      beguiled the journey to that city by repeating several times&mdash;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      what I regret; they will think they petrified us.&rdquo; But Bessie Alden seemed
      to regret nothing.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
&ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
